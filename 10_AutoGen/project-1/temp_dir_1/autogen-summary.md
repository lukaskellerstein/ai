 i   AutoGen is a tool designed to simplify  the creation and maintenance of programs that contain large amounts  of repetitious text  It is especially valuable in programs that have  several blocks of text that must be kept synchronized  AutoGen will accept either its own definition format  or XML files as definition input  in addition to CGI data  for producing dynamic HTML  and traditional AutoGen definitions  A common example where this would be useful is in creating and maintaining the code required for processing program options   Processing options requires multiple constructs to be maintained in parallel in different places in your program  Options maintenance needs to be done countless times  So  AutoGen comes with an add on package named AutoOpts that simplifies the maintenance and documentation of program options  AutoGen is known to work on GNU Linux  BSD  Apple s OS X  SVR4 5  HPUX  SCO OpenServer and Solaris   It is expected that it will work on any reasonably modern UNIX system with an ANSI compliant C compiler  It also runs under WinNT  provided you have CygWin and Guile loaded    Items of interest    The announcement for the AutoGen 5 18 6pre15 source distribution describes recent changes   If you choose to download  please drop  a note and let me know if you built it and what you used it for  Thank you     Autogen code uses a tailored character map for determining which of twenty or so character classes a particular character belongs to  Just using  ctypes h  doesn t work so well for that many categories  So  this generator was developed to create the mappings  char mapper  Here is some general information about code generators and template processors  A brief quote   A template processor  also known as a template engine or a template parser  is software or a software component that is designed to combine one or more templates with a data model to produce one or more result documents   AutoGen is listed there as  complex       An interesting article from Computer World Autoconf configuration macros can be created with an online form   The resulting macro may be added directly to your aclocal m4 file  or the AutoGen definitions may be copied aside and the macro regenerated  should the conftest template be updated   This template is distributed with AutoGen   NOTE This form is temporarily out of service   It must be rebuilt due to server upgrades    AutoGen development is hosted on GNU s Savannah Site  The development page is in projects autogen   People interested in AutoGen are encouraged to download the CVS sources and provide input   Contacting Development  Mailing lists make life easier for tracking general issues  bug reports can be filed here  and feature requests can be filed here   The full documentation is available online here  But be aware that it is the full documentation  intended as a reference   For just learning to understand AutoGen  the introduction has a purpose section and a simple example   For handy reference  Source Forge has a Google link to help you search the documentation  A FAQ  Frequently Asked Questions  is available online  The AutoGen distribution now comes with a   make package   rule that will create a native binary package for Solaris and Linux platforms   I d like to do the same for Debian  Fink and other platforms  too   AutoOpts 41 1  a semi automated command line option parser  is included with AutoGen 5 18 6pre15   It automatically generates everything you need for option processing  including man pages and an  invoking  chapter for your texinfo document   There is a separate AutoOpts chapter in the AutoGen doc  complete with a quick start section   Online  there is a command line option parser Feature Comparison Be aware that this chapter is the complete reference doc for AutoOpts  so don t let it overwhelm you  AutoOpts incorporates a configuration file parser library   This functionality supports AutoOpts features and is also available separately through configFileLoad 3AutoOpts  and a selected subset of libopts exported functions  blocksort is a separately downloadable module that you can use as an example of how to integrate the libopts library component of AutoOpts in your project   The above referenced page also gives information on how to simply use AutoOpts All that notwithstanding  some folks do not want to mess with dependencies on external libraries   There is now help for you  too   getopt 3C  and getopt_long 3GNU  can parse the AutoOpts options instead of the libopts library   It significantly reduces the set of available features  though  AutoFSM  a finite state machine generator  is included with AutoGen   It automatically generates easy to follow tables and a prototype implementation of a Finite State Machine  The snprintfv formatting library is included in the AutoGen distribution  It is a replacement for stdio formatting library   It is a fully portable  consistent and extensible formatting library that replaces the standard printf 3  collection of routines  AutoGen is licensed under the terms of the GPL  However  whatever it produces is the result of the work of creating the appropriate template   In other words  the template author is responsible for choosing the license for the use of that template  My AutoGen related projects use the following licenses   AutoOpts is licensed under the GPL  with the exception that it is allowed to be linked with non free programs   See the text for fuller details  AutoFSM generates Finite State Machines that are licensed under the BSD license  sans the advertising clause  AutoXDR is public domain  fixincludes is part of GCC  so it is GPL ed and donated to the FSF  AutoEvents is undecided  but likely BSD    GCC s FixIncludes was rewritten to make it far  far simpler to specify and maintain system header file edits required by GCC  AutoXDR is a project for augmenting the rpcgen interface   NFSv4 adopted protocols that cannot be directly supported via rpcgen   They combine RPC calls in order to save network traffic   This is a useful enhancement  but you have to marshall and unmarshall your own arguments   With minor reformatting of the ONC IDL and using this program  it is possible to generate the procedures that will do all of this for you   You can get this here  The AutoEvents project is underway  making incredibly slow progress   It is a means for automatically maintaining infrastructure for managing the creation  storage  dispatching and displaying of events   For most large projects  it is necessary to coordinate the display and routing of software initiated messages   This scheme completely alleviates the programmers from the need of making source changes in the event there are changes in central policy    It happens   It also handles much  but not all  of the drudgery of maintaining  managing and triggering these events    In case you want common methods for enabling and disabling them  and deciding on throttling policies   This is not ready yet   It is just coming  eventually   Acknowledgements This program has evolved over a period of several years   During that time   has been a tremendous help in making it more portable  setting up the regression tests and building an entire formatting library because vsprintf was unportable   Thank you Also
