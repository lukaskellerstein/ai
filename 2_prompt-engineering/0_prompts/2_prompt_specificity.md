# Specificity

Be very specific about the instruction and task you want the model to perform. The more
descriptive and detailed the prompt is, the better the results.

Examples:

Not great prompt
`Explain the concept of black holes. Keep the explanation short, only a few sentences, and don't be too descriptive.`

Better prompt
`Use 2-3 sentences to explain the concept of black holes to a high school student.`
