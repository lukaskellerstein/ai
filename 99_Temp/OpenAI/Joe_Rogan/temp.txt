  Joe Rogan: (01:00:00) They didn\u2019t think that this was the case though, when they first started to lock down the country. Do you think that it\u2019s a situation where once they\u2019ve proceeded in a certain way, it\u2019s very difficult to correct course?  Elon Musk: (01:00:18) It\u2019s almost like people really wanted a panic. It\u2019s quite crazy.  Joe Rogan: (01:00:24) But in some places a panic is deserved, right? Like if you\u2019re in the ICU in Manhattan and people are dying left and right and everyone\u2019s on intubators. It seems like when you see all these people on ventilators and so many of them are dying and you see these nurses are dying and doctors are getting sick. In some places that fear is justified, but then in other places you\u2019re reading these stories about hospitals that are essentially half empty. They\u2019re having to furlough doctors and nurses because there\u2019s no work for them.  Elon Musk: (01:01:01) Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty. In some cases they\u2019re at 30% capacity.  Joe Rogan: (01:01:07) Is this because they\u2019ve decided to forgo elective procedures and normal things that people would have to go to the hospital for?  Elon Musk: (01:01:16) Yes. I mean, we\u2019re not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite important. Like you have a bad heart.  Joe Rogan: (01:01:24) Gall bladder disease, yeah, sure.  Elon Musk: (01:01:25) You need a triple bypass. It\u2019s sort of elective, but if you don\u2019t get it done in time, you\u2019re going to die.  Joe Rogan: (01:01:33) Yeah, elective is a weird word.  Elon Musk: (01:01:35) Elective. It\u2019s not like, this isn\u2019t like plastic surgery.  Joe Rogan: (01:01:40) Right, right.  Elon Musk: (01:01:42) It\u2019s more like my hip is, I\u2019m in extreme pain because my hip\u2019s blown out or my knee and I don\u2019t want to go to the hospital. I can\u2019t go to the hospital. People are in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, people that have quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear. So I think it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s not good.  Joe Rogan: (01:02:03) It seems.  Elon Musk: (01:02:03) So I think it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s not good.  Joe Rogan: (01:02:03) It seems like the state of public perception is shifting.  Elon Musk: (01:02:06) It is.  Joe Rogan: (01:02:07) Like people are taking some deep breaths and relaxing and because of the statistics, essentially across the board it\u2019s being recognized that it\u2019s not as fatal as we thought it was. Still dangerous, still worse than a flu, but not as bad as we thought or we feared it could be.  Elon Musk: (01:02:28) Objectively the mortality is much lower. At least a factor of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought.  Joe Rogan: (01:02:41) Do you think that the current way we\u2019re handling this, the social distancing, the mask, the locking down, does this make sense? Is it adequate? Or do you think that we should move back to at least closer to where we used to be?  Elon Musk: (01:03:00) Well, I think proper hygiene is a good thing no matter what.  Joe Rogan: (01:03:03) Yes.  Elon Musk: (01:03:03) Wash your hands and if you\u2019re coughing, stay at home or wear a mask because it\u2019s not good. They do that in Japan. That\u2019s normal. If you\u2019re ill you wear a face mask and you don\u2019t cough on people. I think that would be a great thing to adopt in general throughout the world. Washing your hands is also good.  Joe Rogan: (01:03:27) Well there\u2019s a speculation why men get it more than women because men are disgusting. We don\u2019t wash our hands as much.  Elon Musk: (01:03:33) Men are disgusting it\u2019s true. It\u2019s bad.  Joe Rogan: (01:03:33) It\u2019s true, I admit it, we are all men in this room. We\u2019re all gross.  Elon Musk: (01:03:36) Yeah. Just go to the restroom you can see it\u2019s horrible.  Joe Rogan: (01:03:38) Yes we\u2019re gross. My nine year old daughter yells at me, she goes, \u201cDid you wash your hands?\u201d She makes me go back and wash my hands. She\u2019s right. Nine years old. If I had a nine year old boy do you think he would care? He wouldn\u2019t give a fuck if I washed my hands.  Elon Musk: (01:03:52) True. And I think that there\u2019s definitely some silver linings here in improved hygiene and-  Joe Rogan: (01:04:02) And awareness of potential.  Elon Musk: (01:04:03) Yes. I think this has shaken up the system. the system is somewhat moribund with lot of layers of bureaucracy and I think that we\u2019ve cut through some of that bureaucracy. And at some point there probably will be a pandemic with a high mortality rate. Debate about like what\u2019s high. but I mean something that\u2019s killing a lot of 20 year olds, let\u2019s say. Like if you had Ebola type of mortality.  Joe Rogan: (01:04:35) Spanish flu, something that attacks the immune systems of healthy people.  Elon Musk: (01:04:38) Yeah. Like killing large numbers of young healthy people, to find that as like a high mortality than that. This is at least practice for something like that. And I think there\u2019s this, given it\u2019s just a matter, that there will be eventually some such pandemic.  Joe Rogan: (01:05:05) Do you think that in a sense, the one good thing that we might get out of this is the realization that this is a potential reality? That we got lucky in the sense?, I mean people that didn\u2019t get lucky and died, of course I\u2019m not disrespecting their death and their loss, but I\u2019m saying overall as a culture, as a community, as a human race, as a community, this is not as bad as it could have been. This is a good dry run for us to appreciate that we need far more resources dedicated towards understanding these diseases, what to do in the case of pandemic, and much more money that goes to funding treatments and some preventative measures.  Elon Musk: (01:05:48) Yeah, absolutely. And I think there\u2019s a good chance, it\u2019s highly likely, I think, coming out of this that we will develop vaccines that we didn\u2019t have before for coronaviruses, other viruses, and possibly cures for these. And our understanding of viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it\u2019s received. So there\u2019s definitely a lot of silver linings here.  Joe Rogan: (01:06:24) Potentially, if we act correctly.  Elon Musk: (01:06:26) Yeah. I think there will be a massive lining of here no matter what. Hopefully we can be more of a silver lining than less.  Joe Rogan: (01:06:35) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:06:38) So yeah, this is just kind of like a practice run for something that might in the future have a serious, like a really high mortality rate and we kind of got to go through this without it being something that kills vast numbers of young healthy people.  Joe Rogan: (01:06:59) Yeah. When you made a series of tweets recently, I don\u2019t remember the exact wording, but essentially you were saying, \u201cFree America now.\u201d Like, let\u2019s open it back-  Elon Musk: (01:07:09) That is the exact wording.  Joe Rogan: (01:07:10) That is it? Thank you. How much do you pay attention to the response to that stuff and what was the response like? Did anybody go, \u201cHey man, what the fuck you doing?\u201d Did anybody pull you aside?  Elon Musk: (01:07:22) Yeah, of course.  Joe Rogan: (01:07:24) Who does that? Who gets to do that to you?  Elon Musk: (01:07:28) Well, I mean, I certainly get that. There\u2019s no shortage of negative feedback on Twitter. I get it.  Joe Rogan: (01:07:33) Oh yeah. Twitter. Yeah, but I don\u2019t read that. Do you read it.  Elon Musk: (01:07:37) It\u2019s a war zone.  Joe Rogan: (01:07:38) You do sometimes though, right? You do read it?  Elon Musk: (01:07:40) Yeah. I mean, I scroll through the comments. Like I said, it\u2019s a meme war zone.  Joe Rogan: (01:07:45) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:07:45) I mean, people knife you good and thorough.  Joe Rogan: (01:07:47) It\u2019s something I enjoy about it. Something about the freedom of expression that comes from all these people that do attack you. It\u2019s like, if there was no vulnerability whatsoever, they wouldn\u2019t attack you. And it\u2019s like there\u2019s something about these millions and millions of perspectives that you have to appreciate, even if it comes your way, even if the shit storm hits you in the face.  Joe Rogan: (01:08:23) You got to appreciate, \u201cWow. How amazing is it that all these people do have the ability to express themselves?\u201d I mean, you don\u2019t necessarily want to be there when the shit hits you. You might want to get out of the way in anticipation of the shit storm, but the fact that so many people have the ability to reach out. And I think it\u2019s in a lot of ways it\u2019s a, I don\u2019t want to say a misused resource, but it\u2019s like giving monkeys guns.  Joe Rogan: (01:08:47) They just start, \u201cDa, da, da.\u201d T`hey start gunning down things that are in front of them without any realization of what they\u2019re doing. They have a rock, they see a window, they throw it. \u201cWhoo, look at that. I got Elon mad. Look at that. This guy got mad at me. I fucking took this person down on Twitter. I got this lady fired. Oh, the fucking business is going under because of Twitter Wars.\u201d It seems like there\u2019s something about it that\u2019s this new found thing that, I don\u2019t want to say abuse, but just, I want to say that it\u2019s almost like you hit the button and things blow up. You\u2019re like, \u201cWow, what else can we blow up?\u201d  Elon Musk: (01:09:28) Sure. I mean, I\u2019ve been in the Twitter war zone for, for a while here, so.  Joe Rogan: (01:09:34) Twitter war zone.  Elon Musk: (01:09:36) And it takes a lot to phase me at this point.  Joe Rogan: (01:09:39) Yeah, that\u2019s good too. Right? Like you develop a thick skin.  Elon Musk: (01:09:44) Yeah. You can\u2019t take it personally. A lot of these people don\u2019t actually know you. It\u2019s like if you\u2019re fighting a war and there\u2019s like some opposing soldier that shoots at you, it\u2019s not like they hate you. They don\u2019t even know you.  Joe Rogan: (01:10:00) Right.  Elon Musk: (01:10:00) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:10:01) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:10:01) So just think of it like that. Like they have fire and bullets, whatever. But they don\u2019t know you, so don\u2019t take it personally.  Joe Rogan: (01:10:08) There\u2019s something interesting about it too. When you write something in 280 characters and they write something, it\u2019s such a crude way. It\u2019s like someone sending opposing smoke signals. Your smoke signals. It\u2019s so crude. And especially when you\u2019re talking about something like Neuralink. You\u2019re talking about some future potential where you\u2019re going to be able to express pure thoughts that get conveyed through some sort of a universal language with no ambiguity whatsoever versus tweets.  Elon Musk: (01:10:45) Well, there will always be some ambiguity, but tweets, it\u2019s hard. But maybe there should be like a sarcasm flag or something.  Joe Rogan: (01:10:54) Right, right.  Elon Musk: (01:10:55) Or a \u201cjust kidding\u201d or-  Joe Rogan: (01:10:57) It seems like it would take away some of the fun from people that know it\u2019s sarcasm. Like if everybody knew that The Onion wasn\u2019t, if you sent people articles. It was something about someone getting angry and an Onion article.  Elon Musk: (01:11:12) Wow, that\u2019s amazing.  Joe Rogan: (01:11:13) You know what I mean? Where they don\u2019t realize what it is. There\u2019s something fun about that for everybody else.  Elon Musk: (01:11:18) Yeah, I think it\u2019s pretty great. It might be the best news source.  Joe Rogan: (01:11:23) Do you know who Titania McGrath is? It\u2019s Andrew Boyle. He\u2019s a British fellow. Brilliant guy who\u2019s been on the podcast before and he has this a fictional character, this a pseudonym Titania McGrath who\u2019s like the ultimate social justice warrior.  Elon Musk: (01:11:42) Is this, like, a female avatar.  Joe Rogan: (01:11:45) Yes.  Elon Musk: (01:11:45) Oh, okay.  Joe Rogan: (01:11:45) A female avatar that\u2019s actually a computer conglomeration of a bunch of faces. It\u2019s not really one person. So, one person can\u2019t be a victim and be angry, but he\u2019s sort of combined these faces to make this one perfect social justice warrior. But I recognized it early on before I met him. That this was parody. This was just fun. And then I love reading the people that don\u2019t recognize that. They get angry. And there\u2019s a lot of people that just get really furious. There\u2019s some fun to that. There\u2019s some fun to the not picking up on the true nature of the signal.  Elon Musk: (01:12:29) I find Twitter quite engaging.  Joe Rogan: (01:12:31) How do you have the time?  Elon Musk: (01:12:34) Well, I mean like five minutes every couple of hours type thing. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting on it all day.  Joe Rogan: (01:12:40) But even five minutes every couple hours, if those are bad five minutes, they might be bouncing around your head for the next 30.  Elon Musk: (01:12:48) Yeah, you have to, like I said, take a certain amount of distance from\u2026 You read this and be like, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s bullets being fired by an opposing army.\u201d Like I said, it\u2019s not like they know you. Don\u2019t take it personally.  Joe Rogan: (01:13:05) Did you feel the same way when CNN had that stupid shit about ventilators with you? I found that both confusing and-  Elon Musk: (01:13:15) Yeah. That was annoying.  Joe Rogan: (01:13:16) It was annoying.  Elon Musk: (01:13:17) It was wrong.  Joe Rogan: (01:13:18) What is also annoying as a person who reads CNN and wants to think of them as a responsible conveyor of the facts. I would like to think that-  Elon Musk: (01:13:26) Well, yeah. I don\u2019t think CNN is that.  Joe Rogan: (01:13:26) I think used to be used to be.  Elon Musk: (01:13:28) Used to be, yeah. What do you think\u2019s the best source of just information out there?  Joe Rogan: (01:13:38) That\u2019s a good question.  Elon Musk: (01:13:40) Let\u2019s say you\u2019re just the average citizen trying to just get the facts, figure out what\u2019s going on. How to live your life and just looking for what\u2019s going on in the world. It\u2019s hard to find something that\u2019s good.  Joe Rogan: (01:14:01) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:14:03) Not trying to push some partisan angle, not trying to not doing sloppy reporting, and just aim it for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing. You\u2019re just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m hard pressed. Where do you go?  Joe Rogan: (01:14:21) I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any pure form. My favorite places are the New York times and the LA times and I don\u2019t trust them a hundred percent. Because also, there\u2019s individuals that are writing these stories. And that\u2019s seems to be the problems, these individual biases and these individual, there\u2019s purposely distorted perceptions, and then there\u2019s ignorantly reported facts, and there\u2019s so many variables. And you got to put everything through this filter of, \u201cWhere\u2019s this person coming from? Did they have political biases? Did they have social biases? Are they upset because of their own shortcomings? And are they projecting this into the story?\u201d It\u2019s so hard.  Elon Musk: (01:15:06) Yeah. I think maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and kind of following them as opposed to publication.  Joe Rogan: (01:15:13) I go with whatever Matt Taibbi says.  Elon Musk: (01:15:15) Okay.  Joe Rogan: (01:15:16) I trust him more than anybody.  Elon Musk: (01:15:17) All right.  Joe Rogan: (01:15:18) Matt Taibbi is onto something. As far as investigative reporters in particular, the way he reported the savings and loan crisis, the way he reports everything. I just listened to him above most above most. He\u2019s my go to guy.  Elon Musk: (01:15:33) All right. I\u2019ll check it out.  Joe Rogan: (01:15:34) Oh, his Rolling Stone articles are amazing. His stuff on the savings and loan crisis, it\u2019s just like, \u201cWhat in the fuck?\u201d And he\u2019s not an economist by any stretch of the imagination. So he had to really deeply embedded himself in that world to try to understand it and to be able to report on it. And with also with a humorous flare.  Elon Musk: (01:15:52) Now that\u2019s nice.  Joe Rogan: (01:15:53) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:15:56) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:15:56) There\u2019s not that many of them. It\u2019s hard. And not a location where like, we are no bullshit. Wearenobullshit.com like the one place where you can say, \u201cThis is what we know, this is what we don\u2019t know. This is what we think.\u201d Not, \u201cThis person\u2019s wrong and here\u2019s why.\u201d Like, ah, God damn it. I can\u2019t. You don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a lot of stuff that is open to interpretation.  Joe Rogan: (01:16:24) This particular coronavirus issue that we\u2019re dealing with right now seems to be a great illuminator of that very fact. Is that there\u2019s so much data. And there\u2019s so much that\u2019s open to interpret. There\u2019s so many thing\u2026 because it\u2019s all happening in real time. Right? And particularly right now in California, we\u2019re in stage two Friday, two days from now. Stage two. Retail stores opening up.  Joe Rogan: (01:16:49) Things are changing. Like, no one knows the correct process that needs to take place to save the most amount of lives, but yet ensure that our culture and that our economy survives. It\u2019s a lot of speculation and guessing. But if you go to certain places, they\u2019ll tell you, \u201cWe know why, and we know this, and we know\u2026\u201d Oh, it\u2019s hard.  Elon Musk: (01:17:15) Yeah. I mean, in general I think we should be concerned about anything that\u2019s a massive infringement on us. Civil liberties.  Joe Rogan: (01:17:26) Yes.  Elon Musk: (01:17:26) So, you got to put a lot of weight on that. A lot of people died to win independence for the country and fight for the democracy that we have. And we should treasure that and not give up our liberties too easily. And I think we probably did that, actually. So.  Joe Rogan: (01:17:48) Well, I like what you said when you said that it should be a choice and that to require people to stay home, require people to not go to work, and to arrest people for trying to make a living. This all seems wrong. And I think it\u2019s a wrong approach. It\u2019s an infantilization of the society. That daddy\u2019s going to tell you what to do.  Elon Musk: (01:18:14) Fundamentally a violation of the constitution. Freedom of assembly and it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t think these things stand up in court, really.  Joe Rogan: (01:18:24) They\u2019re arresting people for protesting because they\u2019re protesting and violating social distancing, and these mandates that tell people that they have to stay home.  Elon Musk: (01:18:33) Yeah. These would definitely not stand up if the Supreme court\u2026 It\u2019s obviously a complete violation of rights.  Joe Rogan: (01:18:41) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:18:42) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:18:42) And again, this is not in any way disrespecting the people who have died from this disease. That\u2019s certainly a real thing to think of.  Elon Musk: (01:18:51) Yeah. I mean it just should be if you\u2019re at risk, you should not be compelled to leave your house or leave a place of safety, but if you\u2019re not at risk, or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life, you should have the right to do that.  Joe Rogan: (01:19:07) And it seems like at this point in time, particularly, our resources would be best served protecting the people that are at risk versus penalizing the people that are not at high risk for living their life the way they did, particularly having a career, and making a living, and feeding your family, paying your bills, keeping your store open, keeping your restaurant open.  Elon Musk: (01:19:30) Yes. I mean, there\u2019s a strong downside to this. So yeah, I just believe this is a free country. You should be allowed to do what you want as long as it does not endanger others.  Joe Rogan: (01:19:46) But that\u2019s the thing, right? This is the argument they will bring up. You are endangering others. You should stay home for the people that that, even if you\u2019re fine, even if you know you\u2019re going to be okay, there\u2019s certain people that will not be okay because of your actions. They might get exposed to this thing that we don\u2019t have a vaccine for, we don\u2019t have a universally accepted treatment for, and then we need to\u2026 There\u2019s two arguments, right?  Joe Rogan: (01:20:12) One argument is we need to keep going, protect the weak, protect the sick, but let\u2019s open up the economy. The other argument is stop placing money over human lives and let\u2019s shelter in place until we come up with some sort of a decision and let\u2019s figure out some way to develop some sort of a universal income, universal basic income plan, or something like that, to feed people during this time while we make this transition.  Elon Musk: (01:20:41) Yeah. I think there\u2019s a, as I said, my opinion is if somebody wants stay home, they should stay home. If somebody doesn\u2019t want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home. That\u2019s my opinion. If somebody doesn\u2019t like that, well that\u2019s my opinion. This notion though, that you can just sort of send checks out to everybody and things will be fine is not true.  Elon Musk: (01:21:08) Obviously several have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty. Like it just makes stuff. There\u2019s just a magic horn of plenty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of plenty. And then if somebody has more stuff than somebody else it\u2019s because they took more from this magic horn of plenty. Now let me just break it to the fools out there.  Elon Musk: (01:21:38) If you don\u2019t make stuff, there\u2019s no stuff. Yeah. So, if you don\u2019t make the food, if you don\u2019t process the food, you don\u2019t transport the food, medical treatment, getting your teeth fixed, there\u2019s no stuff. They\u2019ve become detached from reality. You can\u2019t just legislate money and solve these things. If you don\u2019t make stuff, there is no stuff, obviously. we\u2019ll run out of the stores, run out of the\u2026 the machine just grinds to a halt.  Joe Rogan: (01:22:29) But the initial thought on this virus, the real fear was that this was going to kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, instantaneously in this country. It was going to do it very quickly if we didn\u2019t hunker down, if we didn\u2019t shelter in place, if we didn\u2019t quarantine ourselves, or lock down. Do you think that the initial thought was a good idea based on the perception that this was going to be far more deadly than it turned out to be?  Elon Musk: (01:23:00) Maybe. I think briefly.  Joe Rogan: (01:23:02) Briefly?  Elon Musk: (01:23:03) Briefly, but I think if any kind of sensible examination of what happened in China would lead you to conclusion that that is obviously not going to occur. This virus retreated in Wuhan. There\u2019s was like, I don\u2019t know, hundred thousand people a day leaving Wuhan. So, it went everywhere very fast throughout China, throughout the rest of the world, and the fatality rate was low.  Joe Rogan: (01:23:34) Don\u2019t you think though, it\u2019s difficult to filter the information that\u2019s coming out of China. To accurately, really get a real true representation of what happened. The propaganda machine is very strong. The World Health Organization appears to have been complicit with a lot of their propaganda.  Elon Musk: (01:23:57) The thing is that American companies have massive supply chains in China. Like Tesla, for example. We have hundreds of suppliers. Like tier one, two, three, four suppliers throughout China. So, we know if they are able to make stuff or not. We know if they, if they have issues or not. China is back at full steam and pretty much every US company has some significant number of suppliers in China. So you know if they\u2019re able to provide things or not or if there\u2019s high mortality rate. Tesla has like 7,000 people in China. So, zero people died.  Joe Rogan: (01:24:45) Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Elon Musk: (01:24:46) Zero.  Joe Rogan: (01:24:48) Okay. So that\u2019s a real statistic that\u2019s coming from-  Elon Musk: (01:24:51) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:24:52) Yeah. You know those people.  Elon Musk: (01:24:53) Yeah. We literally run payroll.  Joe Rogan: (01:24:55) Do you think there\u2019s a danger of this\u2026 Yeah?  Elon Musk: (01:24:57) I\u2019m like-  Joe Rogan: (01:24:59) Same folks are there  Elon Musk: (01:25:00) Yeah. Still there.  Joe Rogan: (01:25:01) Do you think there\u2019s a danger of politicizing this? Where this becomes like opening up the country as Donald Trump\u2019s, it\u2019s his goal and then anything he does, there\u2019s people that are going to oppose it and come up with some reasons why he\u2019s wrong, particularly in this climate, where as we\u2019re leading up to November and the 2020 elections. Do you think that this is a real danger in terms of public\u2019s perception that Trump wants to open it up so they knee jerk oppose it because they oppose Trump?  Elon Musk: (01:25:34) I think this has been politicized in both directions, really. Which is not great. Yeah. But like I said [inaudible 01:25:54] I think there\u2019s the question of where do civil liberties fit in this picture? And what can the government make you do, what can they make you not do, and what\u2019s okay? And I think we went too far.  Joe Rogan: (01:26:15) Do you think it\u2019s one of those things where once we\u2019ve gone in this certain direction, it\u2019s very difficult to make a correction? Make an adjustment to realize like, okay, we thought it was one thing. It\u2019s not good, but it\u2019s not what we thought it was going to be. It\u2019s not what we feared, so let\u2019s back up, and reconsider, and let\u2019s do this publicly and say we were acting based on the information that we had initially. That information appears to be faulty and here\u2019s how we move forward while protecting civil liberties, while protecting what essentially this country is founded on, which is a very agreed upon amount of freedom that we respect and appreciate.  Elon Musk: (01:26:58) Absolutely. Well, I think we\u2019re rapidly moving towards opening up the country. It\u2019s going to happen extremely fast over the next few weeks. So, yeah. Something that would be helpful just to add from an informational level is when reporting Covid cases to separate out diagnosed with Covid versus had Covid like symptoms.  Joe Rogan: (01:27:27) Yes.  Elon Musk: (01:27:29) Because the list of symptoms that could be Covid at this point is like a mile long. So, it\u2019s hard to, if you\u2019re ill at all it\u2019s like you could recover it. So, just to give people better information. Definitely diagnosed with Covid or had Covid like symptoms. We\u2019re conflating those two so that it looks bigger than it is. Then if somebody dies, was Covid a primary cause of the death or not? I mean, if somebody has Covid, gets eaten by a shark, we find their arm, their arm has Covid, it\u2019s going to get recorded as a Covid death.  Joe Rogan: (01:28:09) Is that real?  Elon Musk: (01:28:11) Basically.  Joe Rogan: (01:28:11) Not that bad, but heart attacks, strokes-  Elon Musk: (01:28:15) You get hit by a bus.  Joe Rogan: (01:28:15) Cancer.  Elon Musk: (01:28:16) If you get hit by a bus, go to the of the hospital and die, and they find that you have Covid, you will be recorded as a Covid death.  Joe Rogan: (01:28:24) Why would they do that though?  Elon Musk: (01:28:27) Well right now, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I mean, it\u2019s mostly paved with bad intentions, but there\u2019s some good intentions [inaudible 01:28:37] in there, too. And the stimulus bill that was intended to help with the hospitals that were being overwrought with Covid patients created an incentive to record something as Covid that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital\u2019s going bankrupt for lack of other patients. So, the hospitals are in a bind right now. There\u2019s a bunch of hospitals, they\u2019re furloughing doctors, as you were mentioning. If your hospital\u2019s half full, it\u2019s hard to make ends meet. So now you\u2019ve got like, \u201cIf I just check this box, I get $8,000. Put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000 back. Or, I got to fire some doctors.\u201d So, this is tough moral quandary. It\u2019s like, what are you going to do? That\u2019s the situation we have.  Joe Rogan: (01:29:36) What the way out of this? What do you think is, if you had the president\u2019s ear, or if people wanted to just listen to you openly, what do you think is the way out of this?  Elon Musk: (01:29:46) Let\u2019s clear up the data. Clear up the data. So like I said, somebody should be recorded as Covid only if somebody has been tested. Has has received a positive, positive Covid test. Not if they simply have symptoms, one of like a hundred symptoms. And then if it is a Covid death, it must be separated. Was Covid a primary reason for death, or did they also have stage three cancer, or heart disease, emphysema, and got hit by bus and had Covid?  Joe Rogan: (01:30:16) Yeah. I\u2019ve read all this stuff about them diagnosing people as a Covid death despite other variables.  Elon Musk: (01:30:26) This is not a question. This is what is occurring.  Joe Rogan: (01:30:31) And where are you reading this from? Where are you getting this from?  Elon Musk: (01:30:38) The public health officials have literally said this. This is not a question mark.  Joe Rogan: (01:30:39) Right. But this is unprecedented, right? If someone had the flu but also had a heart attack, they would assume that that person died of a heart attack.  Elon Musk: (01:30:47) Yes.  Joe Rogan: (01:30:48) Yeah. So this is unprecedented. Is this because this is such a popular, I don\u2019t want to use that word the wrong way, but that\u2019s what I mean, popular subject? And financial incentives.  Elon Musk: (01:31:01) Yes. And like I said, this is not some sort of a moral [inaudible 01:31:07] of hospital administrators. It\u2019s just, they\u2019re in it. They\u2019re in a tough spot here. They actually don\u2019t have enough patients to pay everyone without furloughing doctors and firing staff. They\u2019re running potentially going bankrupt. So then they\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, well the stimulus bill says we get all this money if it\u2019s a Covid death.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay. They coughed before they died.\u201d In fact, they\u2019re not even diagnosed with Covid. If you had weakness, a cough, shortness of breath. Frankly, I\u2019m not sure how you die without those things.  Joe Rogan: (01:31:51) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:31:52) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:31:53) Right. There\u2019s so many different things that you could attribute to Covid, too. There\u2019s so many symptoms. There\u2019s diarrhea, headaches, dehydration, cough.  Elon Musk: (01:32:03) Yes. But to be clear, you don\u2019t even need to have gotten a Covid diagnosis. You simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it\u2019s Covid. So, then it makes the death count look very high and we\u2019re then stuck in a bind because it looks like the death count\u2019s super high and not going down like it should be. So then, we should keep whatever, keep the shelter in place stuff there, and keep people in their homes, confine people to homes. So we need to break out of this. We\u2019re stuck in a loop. And I think the way to break out of this loop is to have clarity of information.  Joe Rogan: (01:32:51) The clarity of information will certainly help, but altering perceptions, public perception, from people that are basically in a panic, there\u2019s a lot of, essentially, well, at least a month ago-  Joe Rogan: (01:33:03) \u2026there\u2019s a lot of, essentially\u2026 Well at least a month ago, we\u2019re clearly in a panic. I mean, when you look around April 5th, April 6th, people were really freaking out. But here we are May, and May people are relaxing a little bit.  Elon Musk: (01:33:17) Yes.  Joe Rogan: (01:33:17) They\u2019re realizing like, \u201cHey, I actually know a couple of people that got it. It was just a cough,\u201d and I know some people that got it where nothing happened.  Elon Musk: (01:33:24) I know a lot of people who got it. I know zero people who died, but I know a lot of people that got it.  Joe Rogan: (01:33:34) It\u2019s not what we feared. We feared something much worse.  Elon Musk: (01:33:38) That is correct.  Joe Rogan: (01:33:39) So the adjustment\u2019s difficult to make. So you said, first of all we need real data. We need-  Elon Musk: (01:33:44) Just parse out the data. Don\u2019t lump it all together. If you give people, just parse out the data better, clearer information about, like I said, was this an actual COVID diagnosis? Did they get the test and the test came back positive or do they just have some symptoms? Just parse those two out, and then parse out just, if somebody died, did they even have a COVID test or did they just have one of many symptoms. How do you die without weakness? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s impossible, basically.  Joe Rogan: (01:34:22) Of course. Yeah, it\u2019s a good point.  Elon Musk: (01:34:23) If you\u2019re going to die, you\u2019re going to have shortness of breath, weakness and you might cough a little.  Joe Rogan: (01:34:29) So was it quantified? Was it?  Elon Musk: (01:34:31) Yeah, did that person, did they actually have a COVID test and the test come back positive? And then if they died, did they die where COVID was\u2026 It doesn\u2019t have to be the main cause, but it was a significant contributor to their death or was it not a significant contributor to the death?  Joe Rogan: (01:34:50) Right. It\u2019s not as simple as just because you had COVID, covert, killed you.  Elon Musk: (01:34:55) Definitely not.  Joe Rogan: (01:34:56) Right.  Elon Musk: (01:34:57) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:34:57) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:34:58) I mean, people die all the time and they have like flu and other colds and we don\u2019t say that they died of those flu and other colds.  Joe Rogan: (01:35:04) Well, that\u2019s what\u2019s so weird about this.  Elon Musk: (01:35:05) It\u2019s absurd.  Joe Rogan: (01:35:06) It\u2019s so popular and I use that word in a weird way, but it\u2019s so popular that we\u2019ve kind of forgotten people die of pneumonia every day.  Elon Musk: (01:35:15) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:35:15) People die of\u2026 The flu didn\u2019t take a break. \u201cOh, COVID\u2019s got this. I\u2019m going to sit this one out. I\u2019m going to be on the bench. I\u2019m going to wait until COVID\u2019s done before I jump back into the game of killing people.\u201d No, the flu is still here killing people.  Elon Musk: (01:35:29) I mean, every year in the world, several hundred thousand people die directly of the flu.  Joe Rogan: (01:35:33) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:35:34) Not tangentially.  Joe Rogan: (01:35:36) Right.  Elon Musk: (01:35:36) Not every-  Joe Rogan: (01:35:37) 61,000 in this country last year.  Elon Musk: (01:35:40) Yeah. And we\u2019re only 5% of the world.  Joe Rogan: (01:35:42) And then there\u2019s cigarettes.  Elon Musk: (01:35:43) So, oh man, cigarettes. Now cigarettes will really kill you.  Joe Rogan: (01:35:46) That\u2019s a weird one. Right? We\u2019re terrified of this disease that we\u2019re projected. It could potentially kill 100,000 if not 200,000 Americans this year. But With cigarettes kill 500,000 and you don\u2019t hear a peep out of any politician. There\u2019s no one running for Congress that\u2019s trying to ban cigarettes. There\u2019s no one running for Senate that wants to put some education plan in place that\u2019s going to stop cigarettes in their tracks.  Elon Musk: (01:36:11) Yeah. I mean, several years ago, or maybe longer, 10 years ago, I helped make a movie called Thank You for Smoking.  Joe Rogan: (01:36:19) Oh, I saw that.  Elon Musk: (01:36:20) Yeah. It\u2019s, it\u2019s crazy. Barbecuing your lungs is just bad news. It\u2019s not good. Turning your lungs into smoked beef, not great. So yeah. Tylenol, by the way, also kills a lot of people.  Joe Rogan: (01:36:49) What is the number for Tylenol every year?  Elon Musk: (01:36:52) I\u2019m not sure the exact number. But until the opioid crisis, I believe Tylenol was the number one killer of all drugs.  Joe Rogan: (01:36:59) Wow.  Elon Musk: (01:37:00) Because basically, if you get drunk and take a lot of Tylenol, acetaminophen, essentially it causes liver failure. So people would like get wasted and then have a headache and then pop a ton of Tylenol, its curtains.  Joe Rogan: (01:37:18) Wow.  Elon Musk: (01:37:19) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:37:19) Curtains is a funny word.  Elon Musk: (01:37:22) Yeah. But nobody\u2019s, raging against Tylenol.  Joe Rogan: (01:37:26) Yeah. It\u2019s weird. Acceptable deaths are weird. And that\u2019s the slippery slope about this. People shaming people for wanting to go back to work. \u201cAnd other people are going to die.\u201d Well, if you drive, do you drive? [inaudible 01:37:40] you should stop driving because people die from driving. So you, you definitely should fill up all the swimming pools because like 50 people die every day in this country from swimming. So let\u2019s not swim anymore.  Elon Musk: (01:37:53) Yeah, water is really dangerous.  Joe Rogan: (01:37:55) We need to chop down all the coconut trees.  Elon Musk: (01:37:56) Stop water.  Joe Rogan: (01:37:57) Coconuts kill 150 people every year.  Elon Musk: (01:37:59) Yes.  Joe Rogan: (01:37:59) Cut down all the coconut trees. We need those people.  Elon Musk: (01:38:02) Yes.  Joe Rogan: (01:38:02) It\u2019s, at a certain point in time, it\u2019s\u2026 Yeah, we\u2019re vulnerable and also, we have a finite existence no matter what.  Elon Musk: (01:38:12) We do. Nobody lives forever.  Joe Rogan: (01:38:14) Right.  Elon Musk: (01:38:16) I mean I think, you want to look at say deaths as like the, \u201cbut for this disease, whatever, they would have lived X number of years.\u201d  Joe Rogan: (01:38:25) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:38:25) So, if somebody dies when they\u2019re 20 and could have lived till 80, they lost 60 years. But if somebody dies when they\u2019re 80 and they might\u2019ve lived till 81 they lost one year.  Joe Rogan: (01:38:37) Yes.  Elon Musk: (01:38:37) So it\u2019s, \u201cHow many life years were lost\u201d is probably the right metric to use.  Joe Rogan: (01:38:45) I don\u2019t read my own comments, but I do read other people\u2019s comments. And I was reading this one little Twitter beef that was going on where someone was saying that COVID takes an average of 10 years off people\u2019s lives and we should appreciate those 10 years. And then someone else said-  Elon Musk: (01:39:00) It\u2019s not true.  Joe Rogan: (01:39:01) I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not true.  Elon Musk: (01:39:01) Yeah definitely not.  Joe Rogan: (01:39:02) It\u2019s the Twitter, it\u2019s the world.  Elon Musk: (01:39:03) Oh my god.  Joe Rogan: (01:39:04) But someone else said \u201cThe average age of people who die from COVID is older than the average age people die.\u201d  Elon Musk: (01:39:13) Let\u2019s just say, it\u2019s about the same.  Joe Rogan: (01:39:16) That\u2019s a beautiful way of looking at it. I mean it\u2019s unfortunate. It sucks, but it sucks if grandpa dies of Alzheimer\u2019s or emphysema or leukemia. It sucks. It sucks when someone you love dies.  Elon Musk: (01:39:29) Yes. I mean actually, I think a lesson to be taken here that I think is quite important is that, if you have your grandparents and that they\u2019re age of grandparents, really be careful with, any kind of flu or cold or something that that is not dangerous to kids or young adults, but is dangerous to the elderly. Basically, if your kid\u2019s got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents, no matter what it is. There\u2019re things where a young immune system has no problem, an older one has a problem. In fact a lot of the deaths are literally, it\u2019s tragic, but they\u2019re, they\u2019re intra-family. It\u2019s, the little kid had a cold or flu and they [crosstalk 01:40:31].  Joe Rogan: (01:40:31) Give it to grandpa.  Elon Musk: (01:40:32) Yeah. They had the family gathering. And they don\u2019t know that this is a big deal. But it\u2019s just important to remember when you get old, your immune system\u2019s just not that strong. And so, just be careful with your loved ones who are elderly.  Joe Rogan: (01:40:48) And I think there is some true objective understanding of the immune system and the ways to boost that immune system. And I really think that information should be distributed in a way, a nonjudgmental way, but like, \u201cLook, this is a scientifically proven way that we can boost our immune system and it might save your life and it might save the life of your loved ones.\u201d And maybe we could teach this to our grandparents and our parents and people that are vulnerable, vitamin C, heat shock proteins, all these different variables that we know contribute to a stronger immune system.  Elon Musk: (01:41:30) Yeah. Actually, just a thing that is tough. As you get older, you tend to put on weight, certainly that\u2019s happening with me. The older I get like, \u201cDamn, sure harder to stay lean.\u201d That\u2019s for sure. And so, actually, being overweight is a big deal. It\u2019s a fact. Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:42:00) The New York hospital said it was the number one factor for severe COVID symptoms was obesity. That was the number one factor.  Elon Musk: (01:42:08) That\u2019s correct. It is, yes, exactly.  Joe Rogan: (01:42:12) But it\u2019s also, we live in a world where people want to be sensitive to other people\u2019s feelings.  Elon Musk: (01:42:18) Yeah, absolutely.  Joe Rogan: (01:42:19) So they don\u2019t want to bring up the fact that being fat\u2019s bad for you. It\u2019s a judgmental on your\u2026  Elon Musk: (01:42:25) Food\u2019s great.  Joe Rogan: (01:42:26) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:42:26) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:42:27) I do love food.  Elon Musk: (01:42:28) Yeah. I mean to be totally frank, I mean, speaking for myself, I\u2019d rather read tasty food and live a shorter life.  Joe Rogan: (01:42:37) Yeah. Those moments of enjoying a great meal.  Elon Musk: (01:42:40) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:42:41) And then even talking about it, they\u2019re valuable. They\u2019re worth something. Yeah. We don\u2019t want to eat Soylent Green and live to be 160.  Elon Musk: (01:42:47) No. Tasty food is great, it\u2019s one of the best things about life.  Joe Rogan: (01:42:53) It really is. Yeah. It\u2019s an art form as well.  Elon Musk: (01:42:55) Yeah, absolutely.  Joe Rogan: (01:42:55) It\u2019s like fine food, it\u2019s a delicious sandcastle. It\u2019s temporary. It doesn\u2019t last very long. But there\u2019s something about it that\u2019s very pleasing.  Elon Musk: (01:43:08) Yeah. I don\u2019t know what advice to give, maybe having tasty food but smaller amounts of it.  Joe Rogan: (01:43:19) Yeah. And I think, regulated feeding windows, really the way to go, some sort of an intermittent fasting approach.  Elon Musk: (01:43:27) Sure.  Joe Rogan: (01:43:27) When I started doing that, I found myself to be quite a bit healthier. When I\u2019ve deviated from that I\u2019ve gained weight.  Elon Musk: (01:43:34) So what?  Joe Rogan: (01:43:35) 16 hours?  Elon Musk: (01:43:36) Well Okay, yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:43:37) I like 16 hours. Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:43:38) So like at night or at a certain [crosstalk 01:43:40]  Joe Rogan: (01:43:40) Yeah. So I get to a certain point and then I count out, I usually hit the stopwatch on my phone and then I look at 15 hours, and I\u2019m like \u201cOh, okay. Got an hour before I can eat.\u201d  Elon Musk: (01:43:52) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:43:52) And so anything in between that is just water or coffee.  Elon Musk: (01:43:56) Actually, this may be a useful bit of advice for people, but eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep. And it can actually cause heartburn, that you don\u2019t even know is happening, and that subtle heartburn, it affects your sleep because your horizontal and your body\u2019s digesting. So if you want to improve the quality of your sleep and be healthier, it\u2019s do not eat right before we go to sleep. It\u2019s one of the worst things you could do.  Joe Rogan: (01:44:31) Some of the biggest mistakes I\u2019ve ever made. I\u2019ve done that, particularly after comedy shows, if I\u2019m starving, I\u2019ll come home and I\u2019ll eat. And then I go to bed and I just feel like shit and I wake up in the middle of the night.  Elon Musk: (01:44:43) It\u2019s going to crush your sleep and it\u2019s going to damage your pyloric sphincter and your esophagus. In fact drinking and then going to sleep, that\u2019s one of the worst things you could do.  Joe Rogan: (01:44:54) Yes.  Elon Musk: (01:44:56) So just try to avoid drinking and eating-  Joe Rogan: (01:45:01) Booze, drinking booze.  Elon Musk: (01:45:03) Yeah, exactly. Small amounts of alcohol, evidence suggests it doesn\u2019t have a negative effect on-  Joe Rogan: (01:45:15) I put it in the same category as delicious food. It kind of makes things a little more fun. I like it.  Elon Musk: (01:45:19) Yeah. I mean some of the people who\u2019ve lived the longest, there was a woman in France who I think, maybe has the record or close to it, and she had a glass of wine every day. Small amounts is fine. But yeah, I learned this like quite late in life. It\u2019s like, just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep, and your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot.  Joe Rogan: (01:45:51) For sure, yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:45:52) It\u2019s a big deal and I think, not widely known.  Joe Rogan: (01:45:54) Do you have time to exercise?  Elon Musk: (01:45:59) A little bit.  Joe Rogan: (01:46:01) Do you have a trainer or anything?  Elon Musk: (01:46:03) I do, although I haven\u2019t seen him for a while. But yeah, especially if I\u2019m out, say we\u2019re working on Starship or something South Texas and I\u2019m just living in my, I got a little house there in Boca Chica village, and I don\u2019t have much to do, so. Or I\u2019m working and I\u2019ll just lift some weights or something. Some people love running, I don\u2019t love running. But if-  Joe Rogan: (01:46:35) What do you like to do exercise wise?  Elon Musk: (01:46:39) To be totally frank, I wouldn\u2019t exercise at all if I could. I prefer not to exercise, but if I\u2019m going to exercise, I\u2019ll lift some weights and then kind of run on a treadmill and maybe watch a show, if there\u2019s a compelling show that pulls you in.  Joe Rogan: (01:46:57) Right. Yeah. That\u2019s a good thing to do. Watch a good movie or episode of Black Mirror or something like that, it\u2019s great.  Elon Musk: (01:47:04) Man, don\u2019t watch Black Mirror before going to bed either.  Joe Rogan: (01:47:06) Well don\u2019t watch Black Mirror today. It\u2019s too fucking accurate.  Elon Musk: (01:47:10) Yeah, exactly. It\u2019s like, \u201cWait, that\u2019s already happened in real life.\u201d  Joe Rogan: (01:47:13) Yeah. They\u2019re too close.  Elon Musk: (01:47:15) It\u2019s too close.  Joe Rogan: (01:47:16) Well even\u2026 Jamie, didn\u2019t you say that the guy who makes Black Mirror-  Jamie: (01:47:19) Today at\u2026 Oh my Mic\u2019s off. Yeah he said it\u2019s not a good time to start season six.  Joe Rogan: (01:47:25) Yeah, he wants to hold off because reality-  Elon Musk: (01:47:27) He\u2019s nailed it?  Joe Rogan: (01:47:28) \u2026is black mirror.  Elon Musk: (01:47:29) Oh man.  Joe Rogan: (01:47:30) It\u2019s like he\u2019s going to have to reassess and attack it from a different angle. you should try something that\u2019s fun to do. That\u2019s not just, like learn a martial art or something like that.  Elon Musk: (01:47:43) I did martial arts when I was kid. Liked it.  Joe Rogan: (01:47:44) Did you? What\u2019d you do?  Elon Musk: (01:47:48) I did a TaeKwonDo. I did Karate, [foreign language 00:14:51] [crosstalk 01:47:52].  Joe Rogan: (01:47:55) Oh, alright, cool.  Elon Musk: (01:47:57) And Judo.  Joe Rogan: (01:47:58) Oh, so you really branched out.  Elon Musk: (01:47:59) Yeah. And did Brazilian Jujitsu briefly.  Joe Rogan: (01:48:07) Did you? Where?  Elon Musk: (01:48:09) In Palo Alto.  Joe Rogan: (01:48:10) Really?  Elon Musk: (01:48:10) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:48:11) Oh no shit. I was going to suggest that. That\u2019s a great thing for people. That\u2019s a thing about jujitsu, if you look at it from the outside you think, \u201cOh bunch of meatheads strangling each other.\u201d  Elon Musk: (01:48:22) Sure.  Joe Rogan: (01:48:22) But they\u2019re some of the smartest people I know, are jujitsu fiends because, first of all, they get introduced to it because usually either they want to exercise or learn some self-defense, but then they realize that it\u2019s essentially like a language with your body. Like you\u2019re having an argument with someone with some sort of a physical language. And it\u2019s really complex and the more access to vocabulary and the sharper your words are, the more you\u2019ll succeed in these ventures. That\u2019s really an accurate analogy of what jujitsu is.  Elon Musk: (01:48:57) Yeah. I mean, I kind of got, probably like a lot of people, for the way-early day, the first MMA fights and Royce Gracie, and he was just like incredible. And it was like-  Joe Rogan: (01:49:09) Technique.  Elon Musk: (01:49:10) Yeah. He was winning against people way bigger and that kind of thing. And it was just like \u201cWhoa, this is cool.\u201d  Joe Rogan: (01:49:15) It was what martial arts were supposed to be, when we were kids. When you saw Bruce Lee fuck-up all these big giant guys. Like, \u201cWow, martial arts allow you to beat someone far bigger and stronger than you.\u201d  Elon Musk: (01:49:25) Right.  Joe Rogan: (01:49:27) Most of the time that\u2019s not real.  Elon Musk: (01:49:29) Especially if they know martial arts too. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh no.\u201d  Joe Rogan: (01:49:33) Yes. But in the UFC, when Royce Gracie, off of his back, was strangling Dan Severn with his legs. You\u2019re like, \u201cHoly shit, this guy\u2019s being pinned by this big giant wrestler, and he wraps his legs around his neck, and chokes him to the point that guy has to surrender.\u201d Amazing.  Elon Musk: (01:49:50) Yeah, it was amazing. I mean Royce got beaten up pretty bad in some of those.  Joe Rogan: (01:49:55) Well, he definitely had some rough fights-  Elon Musk: (01:49:56) But he won.  Joe Rogan: (01:49:58) He won. Yeah. He\u2019s a legend. But what it showed, I mean I\u2019m a huge lover of jujitsu, what it showed is that there is a method for diffusing these situations with technique and knowledge. And I think it\u2019s also a great way to exercise too because it\u2019s almost like the exercise is secondary to the learning of the thing. The exercise is like you want to develop strength and conditioning just so that you could be better at doing the thing. And the analogy that I use is, imagine if you had a race car and you could actually give the race car better handling and more horsepower just from your own focus and effort. That\u2019s really what it\u2019s like.  Elon Musk: (01:50:39) Yeah, totally.  Joe Rogan: (01:50:40) Yeah. When am I going to be able to-  Elon Musk: (01:50:43) My kids\u2026 I should say, I sent my kids to jujitsu since they were like, I don\u2019t know, six.  Joe Rogan: (01:50:50) Oh, really?  Elon Musk: (01:50:50) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:50:51) Oh, that\u2019s awesome.  Elon Musk: (01:50:51) [crosstalk 01:50:51]. Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:50:53) It\u2019s a great thing to learn. It really is.  Elon Musk: (01:50:56) Yes, seems like a good\u2026 Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:50:56) Yeah. Maybe something like\u2026 mean even if you just have someone who holds the pads for you, you could get a workout in and it\u2019d be fun.  Elon Musk: (01:51:03) Sure.  Joe Rogan: (01:51:06) When am I going to be able to buy one of them roadsters? When\u2019s that happening?  Elon Musk: (01:51:09) Well I can\u2019t say exactly when, but we got to get it\u2026 This COVID thing\u2019s kind of thrown us for a loop.  Joe Rogan: (01:51:22) I\u2019m sure.  Elon Musk: (01:51:23) So, not to blame everything on COVID, but it\u2019s certainly set us back on progress for some number of months. But I mean things were going to get done. Ahead of Roadster are, ramping up model Y production, that\u2019ll be a great car, it is a great car, getting the Berlin Giga-factory built, and also building Y getting expanding the Shanghai factory, which is going great and get this Cybertruck, Semi truck, Roadster. Roadster is kind of like dessert. We gotta get the meat and potatoes and greens and stuff.  Joe Rogan: (01:52:18) But Roadster comes before cyber truck?  Elon Musk: (01:52:24) I mean, I think we should do Cybertruck first, before Roadster.  Joe Rogan: (01:52:29) Interesting.  Elon Musk: (01:52:29) Now some of the-  Joe Rogan: (01:52:30) I\u2019m not mad at that.  Elon Musk: (01:52:31) Some of the things for Roadster, the tri-motor, plaid powertrain, we\u2019re going to have that in model S. So that\u2019s like part one of the ingredients that\u2019s needed for Roadster, is the plaid powertrain, the more advanced battery pack. That kind of thing.  Joe Rogan: (01:52:48) I wanted to ask you about this before I forgot. There\u2019s a company that\u2019s called Apex is taking your Teslas and they\u2019re giving it a wider base and wider tires and a little bit more advanced suspension.  Elon Musk: (01:53:01) Sure.  Joe Rogan: (01:53:01) How do you feel about that?  Elon Musk: (01:53:02) Sounds good to me, sure.  Joe Rogan: (01:53:02) Do you work with them? Are you cool with those people?  Elon Musk: (01:53:05) Yeah, I mean, go ahead.  Joe Rogan: (01:53:08) They\u2019re jazzing stuff up with carbon fiber and doing a bunch of interior choices. You\u2019re cool with\u2026 You can\u2019t fuck with that. You don\u2019t have time. So is it good that someone comes along and has that sort of specialty operation?  Elon Musk: (01:53:20) Yeah. I\u2019ve got no problem.  Joe Rogan: (01:53:20) That\u2019s what it\u2019s called, right? It\u2019s like\u2026 Jamie, is it called Apex?  Jamie: (01:53:23) Yeah. I got a Unplugged Performance S-APEX.  Joe Rogan: (01:53:26) That\u2019s right. Unplugged Performance. Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:53:28) Yeah. You could for sure, lighten the car up and improve tire traction and-  Joe Rogan: (01:53:35) Have you seen that company\u2019s stuff? What they do?  Elon Musk: (01:53:37) I don\u2019t know specifically, but there\u2019s-  Joe Rogan: (01:53:39) It\u2019s pretty dope. They make it pretty dope looking\u2026 They take model S and they widen it and give it a bunch of carbon fiber. That\u2019s it, right there.  Elon Musk: (01:53:46) Cool.  Joe Rogan: (01:53:46) Ooh-la-la, look at that.  Elon Musk: (01:53:48) That looks pretty nice.  Joe Rogan: (01:53:48) Yeah, it does. Now, the plaid version of the model S, are you going to widen the track and do a bunch of different, I know you guys are testing at the Nurburgring. Can you not talk about that?  Elon Musk: (01:54:01) Well, I think we\u2019ve got to leave that for a proper sort of product unveil.  Joe Rogan: (01:54:06) I understand.  Elon Musk: (01:54:06) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:54:07) I understand. Last time you were here you convince me to buy a Tesla. I bought it and it\u2019s fucking insane.  Elon Musk: (01:54:15) Oh great. Glad you like it.  Joe Rogan: (01:54:15) Aw Man.  Elon Musk: (01:54:15) Pretty fun.  Joe Rogan: (01:54:16) I don\u2019t\u2026 It\u2019s not just pretty fun. The way I\u2019ve described it is, it makes other cars seem stupid. They just seem dumb. And I love dumb things. I love dumb cars. Like I love campfires. I love campfires. I have a 1993 Porsche that\u2019s air cooled.  Elon Musk: (01:54:32) Sure.  Joe Rogan: (01:54:33) It\u2019s not that fast. It\u2019s really slow compared to the Tesla really.  Elon Musk: (01:54:36) Yeah, actually, it\u2019s really quite slow. But, okay, sure.  Joe Rogan: (01:54:38) But there\u2019s something engaging about the mechanical, just like the gears and, it\u2019s very analog. But it\u2019s so stupid in comparison to the Tesla. Like when I want to go somewhere in the model S, I hit the gas and it just goes, whee. It just, it like violates time.  Elon Musk: (01:54:57) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:54:57) Yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:54:59) You\u2019ve tried it like Ludicrous Plus and stuff like that?  Joe Rogan: (01:55:01) Oh yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:55:01) Yeah. Cool.  Joe Rogan: (01:55:02) Yeah. Oh yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:55:04) We just did a software update where it\u2019ll do, like a, cheetah stance. So yeah. So, because it\u2019s got a dynamic air suspension so it lowers the back.  Joe Rogan: (01:55:13) Oh Jesus.  Elon Musk: (01:55:15) Just like a sprinter basically.  Joe Rogan: (01:55:16) Right.  Elon Musk: (01:55:16) Like what do you do if you\u2019re a sprinter, you hunker down and then shoo. So I shaved like a 10th of a second off the 0 to 60. I mean it\u2019s pretty fun.  Joe Rogan: (01:55:26) It\u2019s so\u2026 I\u2019ve taken so many people. And, I take them for the Holy shit moment. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou ready?\u201d like \u201cHang on there.\u201d and then I stomp on the gas-  Elon Musk: (01:55:34) And they\u2019ve never felt anything like it.  Joe Rogan: (01:55:35) It\u2019s confusing.  Elon Musk: (01:55:37) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:55:37) It really is.  Elon Musk: (01:55:38) Sure.  Joe Rogan: (01:55:40) The instant torque and just the sheer acceleration is baffling.  Elon Musk: (01:55:44) It\u2019s baffling.  Joe Rogan: (01:55:45) It\u2019s baffling.  Elon Musk: (01:55:45) They\u2019ve never felt it.  Joe Rogan: (01:55:46) No.  Elon Musk: (01:55:46) It\u2019s faster than falling.  Joe Rogan: (01:55:48) It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s so fast. It\u2019s a roller coaster. And my family yells at me when I stomp the gas. Like I tell my kids, I\u2019m like, \u201cYou want to feel it? You want to feel it?\u201d they\u2019re like \u201cDo it, do it, do it.\u201d my wife\u2019s like, \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d Boom. And even if I just do it on the highway for a couple of seconds, it\u2019s very exciting.  Elon Musk: (01:56:04) Yeah, pretty fun.  Joe Rogan: (01:56:05) It\u2019s very fun.  Elon Musk: (01:56:05) Yeah. It\u2019s like having your own roller coaster on tap.  Joe Rogan: (01:56:07) It really is like a roller coaster on tap. Without the loop de loops. But, the pinning to your seat, it seems like you\u2019re not supposed to be able to experience that from some sort of a consumer vehicle that a regular person could buy, if you have the money. It seems too crazy. And then the idea that this Roadster is a half of a second faster than that? That\u2019s madness.  Elon Musk: (01:56:32) Well with a Roadster, we\u2019re going to do some things that are kind of unfair. So we\u2019re going to take some things from Cadillac rocket world and put them on a car, so.  Joe Rogan: (01:56:44) Oh, I\u2019ve read about that. Explain that. Like what do you?  Elon Musk: (01:56:47) Well, like I said, we can\u2019t do the product unveil right here. But, it\u2019s going to do some things that are unfair.  Joe Rogan: (01:56:52) Unfair.  Elon Musk: (01:56:56) When we do the unveil of the Roadster, let me just say that anyone who\u2019s been waiting, they won\u2019t be sorry. They won\u2019t be sorry.  Joe Rogan: (01:57:04) Oh, but sure, well anything that goes 0 to 60, what is it 1.9? Is that the 0 to 60?  Elon Musk: (01:57:09) That\u2019s the base model.  Joe Rogan: (01:57:12) What\u2019s the top of the food chain model?  Elon Musk: (01:57:14) [inaudible 00:01:57:14].  Joe Rogan: (01:57:16) Okay. Faster than that. Let\u2019s just say faster than that.  Elon Musk: (01:57:18) Faster than that, yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:57:18) That seems so crazy to me. Now, what was it like when the dude threw the steel balls at the window and they were supposed to not break, and it broke?  Elon Musk: (01:57:29) Well, yeah. I mean-  Joe Rogan: (01:57:30) I know, extenuating circumstances.  Elon Musk: (01:57:31) \u2026at least you know that our demos are authentic, because I was not expecting that and then I think I muttered, under my breath, like \u201cHoly shit\u201d.  Joe Rogan: (01:57:43) Yeah. You didn\u2019t get mad though.  Elon Musk: (01:57:45) No-  Joe Rogan: (01:57:46) You didn\u2019t Steve jobs it.  Elon Musk: (01:57:49) No, I definitely swore, I didn\u2019t think the micro pick it up but it did. But, so like we practiced this, behind the scenes. At Tesla, we don\u2019t do like tons of practice for our demos, because we\u2019re working on the cars. We\u2019re building new technologies and improving the fundamental product. So we\u2019re not spending, doing hundreds of practice things or anything like that. We don\u2019t have time for that. But, just hours before the demo, both Franz, head of design and I were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window, and it\u2019s bouncing right off. And like, \u201cOkay, this seems pretty good. It seems like we got it.\u201d Okay? And then, we think what happened was, when Franz hit the door with the sledgehammer-  Joe Rogan: (01:58:51) Oh, yeah.  Elon Musk: (01:58:51) \u2026show, this is exoskeleton, high strength, hardened steel. You can literally wind up with a sledgehammer, full on double-handed sledgehammer and hit the door and there\u2019s not even a dent. It\u2019s cool. But we think that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom and then, once you crack the corner of the glass it\u2019s game over. So then when you threw the ball that\u2019s what cracked the glass.  Joe Rogan: (01:59:24) So in hindsight-  Elon Musk: (01:59:25) It didn\u2019t go through though.  Joe Rogan: (01:59:26) It didn\u2019t go through.  Elon Musk: (01:59:26) It\u2019s doesn\u2019t go through.  Joe Rogan: (01:59:26) That\u2019s true. It didn\u2019t shatter the whole thing, like a regular window would either, which would just dissolve. Right? So in hindsight, the ball should have been first, sledgehammer second.  Elon Musk: (01:59:36) Yeah.  Joe Rogan: (01:59:36) You live, you learn.  Elon Musk: (01:59:37) Yeah, exactly.  Joe Rogan: (01:59:39) Listen, man, we\u2019ve taken up a lot of your time. You had a child recently.  Elon Musk: (01:59:42) Yeah, I got to get back to it.  Joe Rogan: (01:59:43) It\u2019s amazing that you had the time to come down here. And I really appreciate that. I appreciate everything you do, man. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out there. And I really appreciate you coming down here and sharing your perspective.  Elon Musk: (01:59:54) Well, I think you\u2019ve got a great show. Thanks for having me on.  Joe Rogan: (01:59:56) Thank you. My pleasure.  Elon Musk: (01:59:58) All right.  Joe Rogan: (01:59:58) Elon Musk, ladies and gentlemen. Good night.  Elon Musk: (02:00:02) Anyway, that should get a little play.
