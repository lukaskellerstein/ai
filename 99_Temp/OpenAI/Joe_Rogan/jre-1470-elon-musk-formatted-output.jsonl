{"time": "02:13", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, little love bugs."}
{"time": "02:14", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah. It\u2019s just you think of them differently when you see them come out and then grow and then eventually start talking to you, like your whole idea what a baby is, is very different."}

{"time": "02:23", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Now, as you get older and get to appreciate it as a mature, fully formed adult, it must be really pretty wonderful."}
{"time": "02:32", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. Great. Wonderful. It\u2019s great. But babies are awesome. Yeah, it\u2019s great. Yeah. Also, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time on AI and neural nets and so you can sort of see the brain develop, which is \u2026 An AI neural net is trying to simulate what a brain does, basically. You can sort of see it learning very quickly. You know, it\u2019s just wow."}
{"time": "03:04", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "You\u2019re talking about the neural net, you\u2019re not talking about an actual baby."}

{"time": "03:09", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "But both of them."}
{"time": "03:10", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yes, but the word neural net comes from the brain. It\u2019s like a net of neurons. Humans are the original gangster of the neural net."}
{"time": "03:26", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "That\u2019s a great way to put it."}
{"time": "03:27", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "03:28", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "When you\u2019re programming artificial intelligence where you\u2019re working with artificial intelligence art, are they specifically trying to mimic the developmental process of a human brain?"}
{"time": "03:41", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "In a lot of ways. There\u2019s some ways that are different. An analogy that\u2019s often used is like we don\u2019t make a submarine swim like a fish, but we take the principles of hydrodynamics and apply them to the submarine."}
{"time": "03:59", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "I\u2019ve always wondered as a lay person, do you try to achieve the same results as the human brain but through different methods? Or do you try to copy the way a human brain achieves results?"}
{"time": "04:10", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I mean, the essential elements of an AI neural net are really very similar to a human brain neural net. Yeah. It\u2019s having the multiple layers of neurons and you know, back propagation. All these things are what your brain does. You have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition and then it\u2019ll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place. It\u2019s interesting. Very interesting."}
{"time": "04:51", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah, I would imagine. The thought of programming something that is eventually going to be smarter than us that one day it\u2019s going to be like, why did you do it that way? When artificial intelligence becomes sentient, they\u2019re like, Oh, you tried to mimic yourself. This is so much better process. Cut out all this nonsense."}
{"time": "05:11", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Like I said, there are elements that are the same but just like an aircraft does not fly like a bird."}
{"time": "05:17", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Right."}
{"time": "05:17", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It doesn\u2019t flap its wings, but the wings, the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as a bird."}
{"time": "05:27", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Now you\u2019re in the middle of this strange time where you\u2019re selling your houses. You say you don\u2019t want any material possessions and I\u2019ve been seeing all that and I\u2019ve been really excited to talk to you about this. Because it\u2019s an interesting thing to come from a guy like yourself. Like why are you doing that?"}
{"time": "05:44", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I\u2019m slightly sad about it, actually."}

{"time": "05:54", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I think possessions kind of weigh you down and they\u2019re kind of an attack vector. They\u2019ll say, \u201cHey, billionaire, you\u2019ve got all this stuff.\u201d Well, now I don\u2019t have stuff now what are you going to do?"}
{"time": "06:08", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Attack vector meaning like people targeted."}

{"time": "06:16", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Okay, and get rid of everything except clothes?"}

{"time": "06:39", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I mean, what\u2019s the worst that could happen? I mean, you\u2019re fine."}
{"time": "06:42", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah, you can always buy more stuff if you don\u2019t like it."}
{"time": "06:44", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I suppose so."}
{"time": "06:46", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah, I mean from the money that you sell all your stuff, you can buy new stuff. Do you feel like people define you by the fact that you\u2019re wealthy and that they define you in a pejorative way?"}
{"time": "06:59", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "For sure. I mean not everyone, but for sure in recent years billionaire has become pejorative like that\u2019s a bad thing. Which I think doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense in most cases. If you basically organized a company \u2026 How does this wealth arise? If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital."}
{"time": "07:44", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "There\u2019s a conflation of consumption and capital allocation. Take Warren Buffet, for example, and to be totally frank I\u2019m not his biggest fan, but you know, he does like have full allocation and he reads a lot of annual reports of companies and all the accounting and it\u2019s pretty boring really. He\u2019s trying to figure out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital? I mean it\u2019s kind of a boring job if you ask me."}
{"time": "08:18", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It\u2019s still a thing that\u2019s important to figure out. Like, which is a company deserving of more or less capital. Should that company grow or expand? Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse? If a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital and if it\u2019s not, it should get less or go out of business."}
{"time": "08:40", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Well, there\u2019s a big difference, too, between someone who\u2019s making an incredible amount of money designing and engineering fantastic products versus someone who\u2019s making an incredible amount of money by investing in companies or moving money around in the stock market or doing things along those lines. It\u2019s a different thing and to put them all in the same category seems, it\u2019s very simple. As you pointed out, it\u2019s an attack vector."}
{"time": "09:06", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, for sure. I think it\u2019s really, I do think there, in the United States especially, there\u2019s an over allocation of talent in finance and law. Basically, too many smart people go into finance and law. This is both a compliment and a criticism. We should have, I think, fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff."}
{"time": "09:37", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "09:38", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "09:39", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Well that would certainly be better for all involved if they made better stuff."}
{"time": "09:43", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Manufacturing used to be highly valued in the United States and these days it\u2019s not. It\u2019s often looked down upon, which I think is wrong."}
{"time": "09:54", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah. Well, I think that people are kind of learning that particularly because of this whole pandemic and this relationship that we have with China, that there\u2019s a lot of value in making things and to making things here."}
{"time": "10:10", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yes. Somebody\u2019s got to do the real work."}

{"time": "10:36", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Did you have a moment where, is this something that this idea of getting rid of your material possessions is it something that built up over time or did you have a moment of realization where you realized that \u2026"}
{"time": "10:47", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while. You know, part of it is like I have a bunch of houses, but I don\u2019t spend a lot of time in most of them. That doesn\u2019t seem like a good use of assets. Somebody could probably be enjoying those houses and get better use of them me."}

{"time": "11:17", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Did you request that the buyer not fuck it up?"}
{"time": "11:19", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, that\u2019s a requirement."}
{"time": "11:20", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Oh, a requirement? That\u2019s a good requirement."}
{"time": "11:23", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "11:24", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "In that case in that house."}
{"time": "11:25", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, it\u2019ll probably sell for less, but still I don\u2019t care."}

{"time": "11:35", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Is it?"}
{"time": "11:35", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It\u2019s a real quirky house, yeah."}
{"time": "11:37", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "What makes you say that? What do you get out of it?"}
{"time": "11:44", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I mean, all the cabinets are like handmade and they\u2019re like odd shapes and there\u2019s like doors to nowhere and strange corridors and tunnels and odd paintings on the wall. Yeah."}
{"time": "12:01", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Did you ever live in it?"}
{"time": "12:02", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It\u2019s very quirky. I did live in it briefly, yeah."}
{"time": "12:06", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "But why do you buy houses? If you own all these houses, do you just get bored and go I think I\u2019d like to have that?"}
{"time": "12:13", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, I had one house and the Gene Wilder house is right across the road from me from my main house. It was going to get sold and then torn down and turned into, you know, be a big construction zone for three years. I was like, whoa, I think I\u2019ll buy it and preserve the spirit of Gene Wilder and not have a giant construction zone. Then I started having some privacy issues where people would just come to my house and start climbing over the walls and stuff. I\u2019m like, man \u2026"}
{"time": "12:54", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Then I sort of bought some of the houses around my house and then I thought at one point, well you know, it\u2019d be cool to build a house. I acquired some properties at the top of Somera Road, which has got a great view, and I was like, okay, well there\u2019s a bunch of sort of small older houses, they\u2019re going to get torn down, anyway. I was like, well, if I collect these little houses then I can build something, I don\u2019t know, artistic like a dream house type of thing."}

{"time": "13:45", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Fuck yeah."}
{"time": "13:45", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Definitely. But then I was like, man, does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I\u2019d be real, you know, ghetto like OCD on the little details and the design, or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars? I should probably do the latter. Like what\u2019s more important? Mars or a house? I\u2019m like Mars. Okay."}
{"time": "14:13", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Is that really how you think? Like, I\u2019d be better off planning on a trip to Mars or getting people to Mars?"}

{"time": "14:27", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Well, I don\u2019t know how you do what you do anyway. I don\u2019t understand how you can run The Boring Company, Tesla, SpaceX, all these different things you\u2019re doing constantly. I just, I don\u2019t understand. I mean, you explained last time you were here how you sort of allocate your time and how hectic it is and insane. I still don\u2019t, the productivity is baffling. It just doesn\u2019t make sense how you can get so much done."}
{"time": "14:52", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, I think I do have high productivity, but even with that there\u2019s still some opportunity to [inaudible 00:14:57] time and allocating time to building a house, even if it was a really great house, it still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary to get us to Mars and helping solve sustainable energy. SpaceX and Tesla are by far, you know, the most amount of brain cycles. The Boring Company does not take, you know, it\u2019s like less than 1% of brain cycles. Then this neural link, which is, I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s like 5% and then \u2026"}
{"time": "15:36", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "5%? That\u2019s a good chunk."}

{"time": "15:39", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "We were talking about that last time and you were trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live, when it\u2019s actually going to be available. Are you testing on people right now?"}
{"time": "15:50", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "No, we\u2019re not testing on people yet, but I think it won\u2019t be too long. I think we may be able to implant a neural link in less than a year in a person I think."}
{"time": "16:06", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "When you do this, is there any tests that you have to do before you do something like this to see what percentage of people\u2019s bodies are going to reject these things? Is there a potential for rejection?"}
{"time": "16:20", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It\u2019s a very low potential for rejection. I mean, you can think of it like people put in heart monitors and things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation obviously like artificial hips and knees and that kind of thing. The probability of, I mean, so it\u2019s well known what will cause rejection and what will not. It\u2019s definitely harder when you\u2019ve got something that is sort of reading and writing neurons that\u2019s generating a current pulse and reading current pulses. That\u2019s a little harder than say a passive device, but it\u2019s still very doable. There are people who have primitive devices in their brains right now."}
{"time": "17:15", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "What kind of devices?"}
{"time": "17:17", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, like deep brain stimulation, I think for Parkinson\u2019s, has really changed people\u2019s lives in a big way, which is kind of remarkable because it kind of like zaps your brain. It\u2019s like kicking the TV type of thing. You think like man, kicking the TV shouldn\u2019t work."}

{"time": "18:18", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, for version one of the device, it would be it basically implanted in your skull. It would be flush with your skull, so you basically take out a chunk of skull, put the Neuralink device in there. You\u2019d insert the electrode threads very carefully into the brain and then you stitch it up and you wouldn\u2019t even know that somebody has it. It can interface basically anywhere in your brain. It could be something that helps cure say eyesight, like returns your eyesight even if you\u2019ve lost your optic nerve type of thing."}
{"time": "19:10", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Really?"}
{"time": "19:10", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, pretty much anything that it could, in principle, fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain. It could restore limb functionality, so if you\u2019ve got an interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that\u2019s like a microcontroller and near muscle groups, you could then create sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who is a quadriplegic to full functionality. Like they can walk around and be normal."}

It could just sort of stop the epilepsy from occurring. It could detect it in real time and then fire a counter pulse and stop the epilepsy. I mean, there\u2019s a whole range of brain injuries. Like if somebody gets a stroke, they could lose the ability to speak and that could also be fixed. If you\u2019ve got like stroke damage or you lose say muscle control over part of your face or something like that.

We\u2019re already partly a cyborg or an AI symbiote, essentially it\u2019s just that the data rate to the electronics is slow. Especially output, like you\u2019re just going with your thumbs.

You\u2019ll be able to interface with each other in some sort of a nonverbal, non-physical way where you will transfer data back and forth to each other without having to actually use your mouth. You\u2019ll make noises."}
{"time": "29:16", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Exactly, so when you \u2026 Like what happens when you, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got some complex idea that you\u2019re trying to convey to somebody else and how do you do that? Well, your brain spends a lot of effort compressing a complex concept into words and there\u2019s a lot of loss, information loss that occurs when compressing a complex concept into words. Then you say those words and those words are then interpreted, then they\u2019re decompressed by the person who is listening. They will, at best, get a very incomplete understanding of what you\u2019re trying to convey. It\u2019s very difficult to convey a complex concept with precision because you\u2019ve got compression, decompression, you may not even have heard all the words correctly and so communication is difficult. What we have here is a failure to communicate. Cool add Luke."}

Well, assuming you believe the belief in physics, which proves to be true, then the universe started off as basically quarks and leptons and it quickly became hydrogen and helium, lithium, basically elements of the periodic table. But it was mostly hydrogen basically. Then over a long period of time, 13.8 billion years later that hydrogen became sentient.

{"time": "39:58", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "The one that just dragged the baby down the street pretty far?"}
{"time": "40:01", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah. It seems pretty conscious, right?"}
{"time": "40:05", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "There\u2019s definitely some degree of consciousness there."}
{"time": "40:08", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah. It\u2019s not like a worm. It seems to be on another level. Yeah, and it\u2019s going to keep going. That\u2019s the real concern when people think about the potential future versions of human beings, especially when you consider symbiotic relationship to artificial intelligence, that will be unrecognizable."}
{"time": "40:29", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "That one day will be so far removed from what this is. We\u2019ll look back on this, the way we look back now on simple organisms that we evolved from. That it won\u2019t be that far in the future that we do have this view back."}
{"time": "40:47", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, I hope consciousness propagates into the future and it gets more sophisticated and complex and that it understands the questions to ask about the universe."}
{"time": "40:58", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Do you think that\u2019s the case? As a human being, as yourself, you\u2019re clearly trying to make conscious decisions to be a better version of you. This is the idea of like getting rid of your possessions and realizing that you\u2019re trying to like, \u201cI don\u2019t like this. I will try to improve this. I would try to do a better version of the way I interface with reality.\u201d That this is always the way things are, if you\u2019re moving in some sort of a direction where you\u2019re trying to improve things, you\u2019re always going to move into this new place where you look back on the old place and go, \u201cI was doing it wrong back then.\u201d So this is an accelerated version of that. A super accelerated version of that."}
{"time": "41:41", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I mean, you don\u2019t always improve, but you can aspire to improve or you can aspire to be less wrong."}
{"time": "41:46", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "41:47", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "This is like, I think the tools of physics are very powerful. Just assume you\u2019re wrong and your goal is to be less wrong. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to succeed every day in being less wrong, but if you\u2019re going to succeed in being less wrong, most of the time you\u2019re doing great."}
{"time": "42:04", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "That\u2019s a great way of putting it. Aspire to be less wrong. But then when people look back in nostalgia about simpler times, there\u2019s that too. It\u2019s very romantic and exciting to look back on campfires."}
{"time": "42:18", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "You can still have a campfire."}
{"time": "42:19", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yes. But will you appreciate it when you\u2019re a super nerd? When you connect it to the grid and you have some skull cap in place of the top of your head and it\u2019s interfacing with the international language that the rest of the universe now enjoys communication with people?"}
{"time": "42:37", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. Sure. I think so. Yeah. I like campfires."}
{"time": "42:43", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "I\u2019m just worried. I mean, everyone\u2019s always scared of change, but I\u2019m scared of this monumental change where we won\u2019t talk anymore. I mean that thing that you [crosstalk 00:42:53]."}
{"time": "42:55", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "We\u2019ll communicate."}
{"time": "42:55", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yes, but there\u2019s something about the beauty of the crudeness of language where when it\u2019s done eloquently, it\u2019s satisfying and it hits us in some sort of a visceral way. Like, ah, that person nailed it. I love that they nailed it. That it\u2019s so hard to capture a real thought and convey it in a way, in this articulate way. You read a quote, a great quote by a wise person. It makes you excited that their mind figured something out, put the words together in a right way that makes your brain pop like, \u201cOh yes. Yes.\u201d"}
{"time": "43:32", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It\u2019s clever compression of a concept and a feeling."}
{"time": "43:36", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "But the fact that a human did it too."}
{"time": "43:38", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, absolutely."}
{"time": "43:39", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Do you think that it will be like electronic music? Like people won\u2019t appreciate it like they appreciate a slide guitar?"}
{"time": "43:47", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I like electronic music."}
{"time": "43:48", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "I do too. Well you make it. I know you like it."}
{"time": "43:51", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Sure."}
{"time": "43:51", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah."}
{"time": "43:55", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, I mean I hope the future is more fun and interesting and we\u2019re just trying to make it that way."}
{"time": "44:01", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "I hope it\u2019s more fun and interesting too."}
{"time": "44:02", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "44:03", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "I just hope we don\u2019t lose anything along the way."}
{"time": "44:06", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "We might lose a little, but hopefully we gain more than lose."}
{"time": "44:11", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah. That\u2019s the thing, right? Gaining more than we lose. Something that makes us interesting is that we\u2019re so flawed."}
{"time": "44:16", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It\u2019s not for sure. Yeah. I mean you look at civilization through the ages, most of them they rose and fell."}
{"time": "44:25", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "44:28", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I do think the globalization that we have, sort of like the meme sphere, is there\u2019s not enough isolation between countries or regions. It\u2019s like if you get, if there\u2019s a mind virus that that mind virus can infect too much of the world. I actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people, because it\u2019s like, man, we don\u2019t ever want everywhere to be the same for sure. Then we need some kind of mind viral immunity. So that\u2019s a bit concerning."}
{"time": "45:11", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Mind viral immunity, meaning that once something like Neuralink gets established, the real concern is something that, I mean you said it\u2019s Bluetooth, right? Or some future version of that. The idea is that something could possibly get into it, fuck it up."}
{"time": "45:27", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "No, I\u2019m talking about like somebody, some cockeyed concept that happens right now."}
{"time": "45:39", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Well I know this virus is in embedded chips, right? They\u2019ve embedded chips and then acquired viruses."}
{"time": "45:46", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, when I\u2019m talking about a mind virus, I\u2019m talking about a concept that infects people\u2019s minds."}
{"time": "45:51", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Oh, okay. Okay. Like cult thinking or some sort of fundamentalism."}
{"time": "45:59", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. It\u2019s just wrongheaded idea that goes viral in an idea sense."}
{"time": "46:08", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Well that is a problem too, right? If someone can manipulate that technology to make something appear logical or rational."}
{"time": "46:16", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. Yeah."}
{"time": "46:18", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Would that be an issue too, this is a very have versus have not issue. If this really does, I mean initially it\u2019s going to help people with injuries, but you said ultimately it could lead to this spectacular cognitive change."}
{"time": "46:35", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yes."}
{"time": "46:36", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "But the people that first get it should have a massive advantage over people that don\u2019t have it yet."}
{"time": "46:43", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, I mean it\u2019s the kind of thing where your productivity would improve, I don\u2019t know, dramatically, maybe by a factor of 10 with it. So you could definitely just, I don\u2019t know, take out a loan and do it and earn the money back real fast. Be super smart."}
{"time": "47:02", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Well in a capitalist society, it seems like you could really get so far ahead that before everybody else could afford this thing and link up and get connected as well. You\u2019d be so far ahead, they can never catch you. Is that a concern?"}
{"time": "47:19", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, it\u2019s not a super huge concern. I mean there are huge differences in cognitive ability and resources already. You can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective that\u2019s far smarter than an individual. I couldn\u2019t personally build a whole rocket and the engines and launch it and everything. That\u2019s impossible."}
{"time": "47:44", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "But we have 8,000 people at SpaceX and you\u2019re piecing it out to different people and using computers and machines and stuff. We can make lots of rockets launch into orbit, dock with the space station and that kind of thing. So that already exists where those corporations are vastly more capable than an individual. But we should be, I think less concerned about relative capabilities between people and more like having AI be vastly beyond us and decoupled from human will."}
{"time": "48:38", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Decoupled from human. So this is the, if you can\u2019t beat them, join them?"}
{"time": "48:43", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "48:44", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "So you feel like it\u2019s inevitable, AI, essentially AI is essentially inevitable."}
{"time": "48:49", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Super sentient to AI. Yeah, like beyond a level that\u2019s difficult to understand and impossible to understand probably."}
{"time": "48:59", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Somehow or another, so it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s a requirement for survival to achieve some sort of symbiotic existence with AI."}
{"time": "49:13", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It\u2019s not a requirement. It\u2019s just if you want to be along for the ride then you need to do some kind of symbiosis. So the way your brain works right now, you\u2019ve got kind of like the animal brain, reptile brain, kind of like the lymphic system basically. You\u2019ve got the cortex. Now the brain purist will argue with this definition, but essentially you\u2019ve got the primitive brain and you\u2019ve got the sort of smart brain or the brain that\u2019s capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey can\u2019t understand."}
{"time": "49:58", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Now your cortex is much, much smarter than your lymphic system. Nonetheless, they work together well. So I haven\u2019t met anyone who wants to delete their lymphic system or their cortex. People are quite happy having both. So you can think of this as being like the computer, the AI is like a third layer, a tertiary layer. So that could be symbiotic with the cortex. It\u2019d be much smarter than the cortex, but you essentially have three layers and you actually have that right now."}
{"time": "50:33", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable of things that your brain is definitely not. Storing terabytes of information perfectly, doing incredible calculations that we couldn\u2019t even come close to doing. You have that with your computer. It\u2019s just like I said, the data rate is slow, the connection is weak."}
{"time": "50:58", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Why is it so disconcerting or why does it not give me comfort to think about? Like when I think about a symbiotic connection to AI, I always think of this cold, emotionless sort of thing that we will become. Is that a bad way to look at it?"}
{"time": "51:18", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I don\u2019t think, that\u2019s not how it would be. Like I said you already are symbiotic with AI or computers."}
{"time": "51:26", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Phones, computers, laptops."}
{"time": "51:28", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, there\u2019s quite a bit of AI going on, artificial neural nets. Increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming more and more. So you are connected, if you use Google Voice or Alexa or one of those things, it\u2019s using a neural net to decode your speech and try understand what you were saying."}
{"time": "51:57", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "If you\u2019re trying to do image recognition or improve the quality of photograph, the neural nets the best way to do that. So you are already sort of a cybernetic symbiote. Like I said, it\u2019s just a question of your data rate. The communication speed between your phone and your brain is slow."}
{"time": "52:26", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "When do you think you\u2019re going to do it? How long will you wait? Once it starts becoming available?"}
{"time": "52:35", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, if it works I\u2019ll do it. Sure."}
{"time": "52:38", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Right away."}
{"time": "52:39", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I mean let\u2019s make sure it works."}
{"time": "52:41", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "How do we make sure it works? We try it on prisoners? What do you do? Take rapists? Cut holes in their head?"}
{"time": "52:49", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "No, like I said, if somebody has got a serious brain injury and people that have very severe brain injuries and then you can fix those brain injuries. Then you prove out that it works and [inaudible 00:53:06] expand and make more and more brain injuries, solve more and more. At a certain age we all are going to get Alzheimer\u2019s or we\u2019re all going to get senile. Then moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing."}
{"time": "53:20", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It\u2019s like you said, okay, well this would allow you to remember your names of your kids and have a normal, a much more normal life where you were able to function much later in life. So I think essentially almost everyone would find a need at some point if you get old enough to use Neuralink. Then it\u2019s like, okay, so we can improve the functionality and improve the communication speed. So then you will not have to use your thumbs to communicate with the computer."}
{"time": "54:02", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Do you ever sit down and extrapolate? Do you ever sit down and think about all the different iterations of this and what this eventually leads to?"}
{"time": "54:14", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, sure. I Think about it a lot. Like I said, this is not something that\u2019s going to sneak up on you. Getting FDA approval for this stuff is not overnight. I don\u2019t know, we probably have to be on version 10 or something before it would realistically be a human AI symbiote situation. You\u2019ll see it coming."}
{"time": "54:53", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "You see it coming, but when do you think it\u2019s going to be? When you\u2019re alone, if you have free time, I don\u2019t know if you have free time, but if you just sit down and think about this iteration, the next onward, keep going and you drag it out with improvements along the way and leaps and bounds and technological innovations. Where do you see it? What are we going to be?"}
{"time": "55:19", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Like when?"}
{"time": "55:20", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "20, 25 years from now? What are we going to be?"}
{"time": "55:30", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, assuming civilization is still around, it\u2019s looking fragile right now. I think we could have, in 25 years probably I would think there could be a whole brain interface."}
{"time": "55:47", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "A whole brain interface?"}
{"time": "55:51", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Something pretty close to that. Yeah."}
{"time": "55:52", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "What do you mean by whole brain interface?"}
{"time": "56:00", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Almost all the neurons are connected to the sort of AI extension of yourself. If you want."}
{"time": "56:16", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "AI extension of yourself."}
{"time": "56:18", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "56:19", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "What does that mean to you, when you say AI Extension of yourself?"}
{"time": "56:25", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, like I said, you already have a computer extension of yourself and your phone and computers and stuff. So, and now online it\u2019s like somebody dies, there\u2019s like an online ghost that they\u2019re still, their online stuff is still alive."}
{"time": "56:41", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "That\u2019s a good way to put it. It is weird when you read someone\u2019s tweets after they\u2019re dead."}
{"time": "56:45", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "56:46", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "56:47", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Instagram and their stories and yeah, whatever Facebook and stuff."}
{"time": "56:51", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "That\u2019s a great way to put it. It\u2019s like an online ghost. That\u2019s very accurate."}
{"time": "56:56", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. So it would just be that more of you would be in the cloud, I guess, than in your body or more of you."}
{"time": "57:13", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Whoa. Now, when you say civilization\u2019s fragile, do you mean because of this COVID-19 shit that\u2019s going on right now?"}
{"time": "57:21", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "What\u2019s that? I never heard of it."}
{"time": "57:22", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "It\u2019s this thing, it\u2019s like some people just get a cough."}
{"time": "57:25", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about."}
{"time": "57:26", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Other people it gets much worse."}
{"time": "57:29", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Sure. Well, yeah. I mean this certainly has taken over the mind space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking."}
{"time": "57:45", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah. Well, out of nowhere. That\u2019s what\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s like you go back to November, nothing. Now here we are, December, January, February, March, April, May, six months. Totally different world. So from nothing to, everything\u2019s locked down. There\u2019s so much conflicting information and conflicting opinions about how to proceed. What has happened, you find things where there was a meat packing plant, I believe in Missouri where 300 plus people were asymptomatic, tested positive or asymptomatic."}
{"time": "58:22", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Then in other places it just ravages entire communities and kills people and it\u2019s so weird. It almost appears, if you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d be like, what? It seems like there\u2019s a bunch of different viruses. It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s the same thing or has a bunch of different reactions to the biological variety of people."}
{"time": "58:45", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, I mean I kind of saw this whole thing play out in China before it played out in the US. So it\u2019s kind of like watching the same movie again, but in English. Yeah, I think the mortality rate is much less than what say the World Health Organization said it was. It\u2019s much, much less. It\u2019s like probably at least order of magnitude less."}
{"time": "59:24", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Well, it seems to be very deadly to very specific kinds of people and people with specific problems."}
{"time": "59:33", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. I mean, you can look at the mortality statistics by age and whether they have comorbidities, like do they have basically existing conditions and by age. If you\u2019re below 60 and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low. It\u2019s not zero, but it\u2019s extremely low."}
{"time": "01:00:00", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "They didn\\u2019t think that this was the case though, when they first started to lock down the country. Do you think that it\\u2019s a situation where once they\\u2019ve proceeded in a certain way, it\\u2019s very difficult to correct course?"}
{"time": "01:00:18", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It\\u2019s almost like people really wanted a panic. It\\u2019s quite crazy."}
{"time": "01:00:24", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "But in some places a panic is deserved, right? Like if you\\u2019re in the ICU in Manhattan and people are dying left and right and everyone\\u2019s on intubators. It seems like when you see all these people on ventilators and so many of them are dying and you see these nurses are dying and doctors are getting sick. In some places that fear is justified, but then in other places you\\u2019re reading these stories about hospitals that are essentially half empty. They\\u2019re having to furlough doctors and nurses because there\\u2019s no work for them."}
{"time": "01:01:01", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty. In some cases they\\u2019re at 30% capacity."}
{"time": "01:01:07", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Is this because they\\u2019ve decided to forgo elective procedures and normal things that people would have to go to the hospital for?"}
{"time": "01:01:16", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yes. I mean, we\\u2019re not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite important. Like you have a bad heart."}
{"time": "01:01:24", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Gall bladder disease, yeah, sure."}
{"time": "01:01:25", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "You need a triple bypass. It\\u2019s sort of elective, but if you don\\u2019t get it done in time, you\\u2019re going to die."}
{"time": "01:01:33", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah, elective is a weird word."}
{"time": "01:01:35", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Elective. It\\u2019s not like, this isn\\u2019t like plastic surgery."}
{"time": "01:01:40", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Right, right."}
{"time": "01:01:42", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It\\u2019s more like my hip is, I\\u2019m in extreme pain because my hip\\u2019s blown out or my knee and I don\\u2019t want to go to the hospital. I can\\u2019t go to the hospital. People are in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, people that have quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear. So I think it\\u2019s a problem that\\u2019s not good."}
{"time": "01:02:03", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "It seems."}
{"time": "01:02:03", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "So I think it\\u2019s a problem that\\u2019s not good."}
{"time": "01:02:03", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "It seems like the state of public perception is shifting."}
{"time": "01:02:06", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It is."}
{"time": "01:02:07", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Like people are taking some deep breaths and relaxing and because of the statistics, essentially across the board it\\u2019s being recognized that it\\u2019s not as fatal as we thought it was. Still dangerous, still worse than a flu, but not as bad as we thought or we feared it could be."}
{"time": "01:02:28", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Objectively the mortality is much lower. At least a factor of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought."}
{"time": "01:02:41", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Do you think that the current way we\\u2019re handling this, the social distancing, the mask, the locking down, does this make sense? Is it adequate? Or do you think that we should move back to at least closer to where we used to be?"}
{"time": "01:03:00", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, I think proper hygiene is a good thing no matter what."}
{"time": "01:03:03", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yes."}
{"time": "01:03:03", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Wash your hands and if you\\u2019re coughing, stay at home or wear a mask because it\\u2019s not good. They do that in Japan. That\\u2019s normal. If you\\u2019re ill you wear a face mask and you don\\u2019t cough on people. I think that would be a great thing to adopt in general throughout the world. Washing your hands is also good."}

{"time": "01:03:38", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yes we\\u2019re gross. My nine year old daughter yells at me, she goes, \\u201cDid you wash your hands?\\u201d She makes me go back and wash my hands. She\\u2019s right. Nine years old. If I had a nine year old boy do you think he would care? He wouldn\\u2019t give a fuck if I washed my hands."}

{"time": "01:04:03", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yes. I think this has shaken up the system. the system is somewhat moribund with lot of layers of bureaucracy and I think that we\\u2019ve cut through some of that bureaucracy. And at some point there probably will be a pandemic with a high mortality rate. Debate about like what\\u2019s high. but I mean something that\\u2019s killing a lot of 20 year olds, let\\u2019s say. Like if you had Ebola type of mortality."}

{"time": "01:04:38", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. Like killing large numbers of young healthy people, to find that as like a high mortality than that. This is at least practice for something like that. And I think there\\u2019s this, given it\\u2019s just a matter, that there will be eventually some such pandemic."}
{"time": "01:05:05", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Do you think that in a sense, the one good thing that we might get out of this is the realization that this is a potential reality? That we got lucky in the sense?, I mean people that didn\\u2019t get lucky and died, of course I\\u2019m not disrespecting their death and their loss, but I\\u2019m saying overall as a culture, as a community, as a human race, as a community, this is not as bad as it could have been. This is a good dry run for us to appreciate that we need far more resources dedicated towards understanding these diseases, what to do in the case of pandemic, and much more money that goes to funding treatments and some preventative measures."}
{"time": "01:05:48", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, absolutely. And I think there\\u2019s a good chance, it\\u2019s highly likely, I think, coming out of this that we will develop vaccines that we didn\\u2019t have before for coronaviruses, other viruses, and possibly cures for these. And our understanding of viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it\\u2019s received. So there\\u2019s definitely a lot of silver linings here."}

{"time": "01:06:26", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. I think there will be a massive lining of here no matter what. Hopefully we can be more of a silver lining than less."}

{"time": "01:06:38", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "So yeah, this is just kind of like a practice run for something that might in the future have a serious, like a really high mortality rate and we kind of got to go through this without it being something that kills vast numbers of young healthy people."}

How amazing is it that all these people do have the ability to express themselves?\\u201d I mean, you don\\u2019t necessarily want to be there when the shit hits you. You might want to get out of the way in anticipation of the shit storm, but the fact that so many people have the ability to reach out. And I think it\\u2019s in a lot of ways it\\u2019s a, I don\\u2019t want to say a misused resource, but it\\u2019s like giving monkeys guns."}

When you write something in 280 characters and they write something, it\\u2019s such a crude way. It\\u2019s like someone sending opposing smoke signals. Your smoke signals. It\\u2019s so crude. And especially when you\\u2019re talking about something like Neuralink. You\\u2019re talking about some future potential where you\\u2019re going to be able to express pure thoughts that get conveyed through some sort of a universal language with no ambiguity whatsoever versus tweets."}

They might get exposed to this thing that we don\\u2019t have a vaccine for, we don\\u2019t have a universally accepted treatment for, and then we need to\\u2026 There\\u2019s two arguments, right?"}
{"time": "01:20:12", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "One argument is we need to keep going, protect the weak, protect the sick, but let\\u2019s open up the economy.

If somebody doesn\\u2019t want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home. That\\u2019s my opinion. If somebody doesn\\u2019t like that, well that\\u2019s my opinion. This notion though, that you can just sort of send checks out to everybody and things will be fine is not true."}

There\\u2019s just a magic horn of plenty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of plenty.

They\\u2019ve become detached from reality. You can\\u2019t just legislate money and solve these things. If you don\\u2019t make stuff, there is no stuff, obviously. we\\u2019ll run out of the stores, run out of the\\u2026 the machine just grinds to a halt."}

{"time": "01:23:57", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "The thing is that American companies have massive supply chains in China. Like Tesla, for example. We have hundreds of suppliers. Like tier one, two, three, four suppliers throughout China. So, we know if they are able to make stuff or not. We know if they, if they have issues or not. China is back at full steam and pretty much every US company has some significant number of suppliers in China. So you know if they\\u2019re able to provide things or not or if there\\u2019s high mortality rate. Tesla has like 7,000 people in China. So, zero people died."}

Do you think that this is a real danger in terms of public\\u2019s perception that Trump wants to open it up so they knee jerk oppose it because they oppose Trump?"}
{"time": "01:25:34", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I think this has been politicized in both directions, really. Which is not great. Yeah.

Make an adjustment to realize like, okay, we thought it was one thing. It\\u2019s not good, but it\\u2019s not what we thought it was going to be. It\\u2019s not what we feared, so let\\u2019s back up, and reconsider, and let\\u2019s do this publicly and say we were acting based on the information that we had initially. That information appears to be faulty and here\\u2019s how we move forward while protecting civil liberties, while protecting what essentially this country is founded on, which is a very agreed upon amount of freedom that we respect and appreciate."}
{"time": "01:26:58", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Absolutely. Well, I think we\\u2019re rapidly moving towards opening up the country.

{"time": "01:27:27", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yes."}
{"time": "01:27:29", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Because the list of symptoms that could be Covid at this point is like a mile long.

We\\u2019re conflating those two so that it looks bigger than it is. Then if somebody dies, was Covid a primary cause of the death or not? I mean, if somebody has Covid, gets eaten by a shark, we find their arm, their arm has Covid, it\\u2019s going to get recorded as a Covid death."}

I mean, it\\u2019s mostly paved with bad intentions, but there\\u2019s some good intentions [inaudible 01:28:37] in there, too. And the stimulus bill that was intended to help with the hospitals that were being overwrought with Covid patients created an incentive to record something as Covid that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital\\u2019s going bankrupt for lack of other patients. So, the hospitals are in a bind right now. There\\u2019s a bunch of hospitals, they\\u2019re furloughing doctors, as you were mentioning. If your hospital\\u2019s half full, it\\u2019s hard to make ends meet. So now you\\u2019ve got like, \\u201cIf I just check this box, I get $8,000. Put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000 back. Or, I got to fire some doctors.\\u201d So, this is tough moral quandary. It\\u2019s like, what are you going to do?

{"time": "01:29:46", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Let\\u2019s clear up the data. Clear up the data. So like I said, somebody should be recorded as Covid only if somebody has been tested. Has has received a positive, positive Covid test. Not if they simply have symptoms, one of like a hundred symptoms. And then if it is a Covid death, it must be separated. Was Covid a primary reason for death, or did they also have stage three cancer, or heart disease, emphysema, and got hit by bus and had Covid?"}

{"time": "01:30:48", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah. So this is unprecedented. Is this because this is such a popular, I don\\u2019t want to use that word the wrong way, but that\\u2019s what I mean, popular subject? And financial incentives."}
{"time": "01:31:01", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yes. And like I said, this is not some sort of a moral [inaudible 01:31:07] of hospital administrators. It\\u2019s just, they\\u2019re in it. They\\u2019re in a tough spot here. They actually don\\u2019t have enough patients to pay everyone without furloughing doctors and firing staff. They\\u2019re running potentially going bankrupt. So then they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOkay, well the stimulus bill says we get all this money if it\\u2019s a Covid death.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOkay. They coughed before they died.\\u201d In fact, they\\u2019re not even diagnosed with Covid. If you had weakness, a cough, shortness of breath.

{"time": "01:32:03", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yes. But to be clear, you don\\u2019t even need to have gotten a Covid diagnosis. You simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it\\u2019s Covid. So, then it makes the death count look very high and we\\u2019re then stuck in a bind because it looks like the death count\\u2019s super high and not going down like it should be. So then, we should keep whatever, keep the shelter in place stuff there, and keep people in their homes, confine people to homes. So we need to break out of this. We\\u2019re stuck in a loop. And I think the way to break out of this loop is to have clarity of information."}

Did they get the test and the test came back positive or do they just have some symptoms? Just parse those two out, and then parse out just, if somebody died, did they even have a COVID test or did they just have one of many symptoms. How do you die without weakness? I don\\u2019t know.

Basically, if your kid\\u2019s got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents, no matter what it is. There\\u2019re things where a young immune system has no problem, an older one has a problem. In fact a lot of the deaths are literally, it\\u2019s tragic, but they\\u2019re, they\\u2019re intra-family. It\\u2019s, the little kid had a cold or flu and they [crosstalk 01:40:31]."}

So if you want to improve the quality of your sleep and be healthier, it\\u2019s do not eat right before we go to sleep. It\\u2019s one of the worst things you could do."}

I mean some of the people who\\u2019ve lived the longest, there was a woman in France who I think, maybe has the record or close to it, and she had a glass of wine every day. Small amounts is fine.

It\\u2019s like, just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep, and your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot."}

Like you\\u2019re having an argument with someone with some sort of a physical language. And it\\u2019s really complex and the more access to vocabulary and the sharper your words are, the more you\\u2019ll succeed in these ventures.

But what it showed, I mean I\\u2019m a huge lover of jujitsu, what it showed is that there is a method for diffusing these situations with technique and knowledge. And I think it\\u2019s also a great way to exercise too because it\\u2019s almost like the exercise is secondary to the learning of the thing. The exercise is like you want to develop strength and conditioning just so that you could be better at doing the thing. And the analogy that I use is, imagine if you had a race car and you could actually give the race car better handling and more horsepower just from your own focus and effort. That\\u2019s really what it\\u2019s like."}

It seems too crazy. And then the idea that this Roadster is a half of a second faster than that? That\\u2019s madness."}

So we\\u2019re not spending, doing hundreds of practice things or anything like that. We don\\u2019t have time for that. But, just hours before the demo, both Franz, head of design and I were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window, and it\\u2019s bouncing right off. And like, \\u201cOkay, this seems pretty good. It seems like we got it.\\u201d Okay? And then, we think what happened was, when Franz hit the door with the sledgehammer-"}

But we think that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom and then, once you crack the corner of the glass it\\u2019s game over.
