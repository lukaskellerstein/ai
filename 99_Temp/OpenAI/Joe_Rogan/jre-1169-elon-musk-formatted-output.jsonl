{"time": "00:05:17", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah. Now, when you're doing this, what is the ultimate plan? The ultimate plan is to have these in major cities, and anywhere there's mass congestion, and just try it out in LA first?"}
{"time": "00:05:26", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. It's in LA because I mostly live in LA. That's the reason. It's a terrible place to dig tunnels. This is one of the worst places to dig tunnels mostly because of the paperwork. You all think it's like, \"What about seismic?\" It's like, actually, both tunnels are very safe in earthquakes."}
{"time": "00:05:45", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Why is that?"}
{"time": "00:05:46", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Earthquakes are essentially a surface phenomenon. It's like waves on the ocean. So, if there's a storm, you want to be in a submarine. So, being in a tunnel is like being in a submarine. Now, the way the tunnel is constructed, it's constructed out of these interlocking segments, kind of like a snake. It's sort of like a snake exoskeleton with double seals."}
{"time": "00:06:15", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "And so, even when the ground moves, the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake, and it doesn't crack or break. And it's extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken. And it's capable of taking five atmospheres of pressure. It's waterproof, methane-proof, well, gas-proof of any kind, and meets all California seismic requirements."}
{"time": "00:06:46", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "So, when you have this idea, who do you bring this to?"}

{"time": "00:06:51", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Well, you're implementing it. So, you're digging holes in the ground."}
{"time": "00:06:54", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yes."}
{"time": "00:06:54", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Like, you have to bring it to someone that lets you do it."}

It's got like a permit for a pit, like pit, and just dug a big pit."}

{"time": "00:08:04", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. And it's a hole in the ground. So then, we got the permit for the pit, and we dug the pit, and we dug it in, like, I don't know, three days, two to three days. Actually, I think two, 48hours, something like that because Eric Carr said he was coming by for the Hype. He's going to attend the Hyperloop Competition. which is like a student competition we have for who can make the fastest part in the Hyperloop. And he was coming."}

There was like wind 24/7. Oh, 24. 48 straight hours, something like that. And dug this big pit, and we're like, \"Show Eric the pit.\" It's like, obviously, it's just a pit. But, hey, a hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground."}

{"time": "00:19:49", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yes. Things are getting more and more connected. They're, at this point, constrained by bandwidth. Our input/output is slow, particularly output. Output got worse with thumbs. You know, we used to have input with 10 fingers. Now, we have thumbs. But images are just, also, other way of communicating at high bandwidth. You take pictures and you send pictures to people. What sends, that communicates far more information than you can communicate with your thumb."}

So, usually, it will be something, some new technology. It will cause damage or death. There will be an outcry. There will be an investigation. Years will pass. There will be some sort of insights committee. There will be rule making. Then, there will be oversight, absolutely, of regulations. This all takes many years. This is the normal course of things."}

If you had seatbelts on, you would be far less likely to die or be seriously injured. It was unequivocal. And the industry fought this for years successfully. Eventually, after many, many people died, regulators insisted on seatbelts. This is a -- This time frame is not relevant to AI. You can't take 10 years from a point of which it's dangerous.

{"time": "00:25:25", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I don't want to jump the gun on that."}
{"time": "00:25:28", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "But what's like the ultimate? What's the idea behind that? Like, what are you trying to accomplish with it? What would you like best case scenario?"}
{"time": "00:25:37", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "I think, best case scenario, we effectively merge with AI where AI serves as a tertiary cognition layer, where we've got the limbic system. Kind of the, you know, primitive brain essentially. You got the cortex. So, you're currently in a symbiotic relationship. Your cortex and limbic system are in a symbiotic relationship. And, generally, people like their cortex, and they like their limbic system. I haven't met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or delete their cortex. Everybody seems to like both."}
{"time": "00:26:12", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "And the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system. People may think that the thinking part of themselves is in charge, but it's mostly their limbic system that's in charge. And the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy. That's what most of that computing power is. It's launched towards, \"How can I make the limbic system happy?\" That's what it's trying to do."}
{"time": "00:26:38", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Now, if we do have a third layer, which is the AI extension of yourself, that is also symbiotic. And there's enough bandwidth between the cortex and the AI extension of yourself, such that the AI doesn't de facto separate. Then, that could be a good outcome. That could be quite a positive outcome for the future."}
{"time": "00:27:03", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "So, instead of replacing us, it will radically change our capabilities?"}
{"time": "00:27:08", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yes. It will enable anyone who wants to have super human cognition, anyone who wants. This is not a matter of earning power because your earning power would be vastly greater after you do it. So, it's just like anyone who wants can just do it in theory. That's the theory. And if that's the case then, and let's say billions of people do it, then the outcome for humanity will be the sum of human will, the sum of billions of people's desire for the future."}
{"time": "00:27:55", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "That billions of people with enhanced cognitive ability?"}

{"time": "00:28:19", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "It will be difficult to really appreciate the difference. It's kind of likehow much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without? You're vastly smarter actually. You know, you can answer any question.

{"time": "00:28:55", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Your phone is already an extension of you. You're already a cyborg. You don't even -- What most people don't realize, they are already a cyborg. That phone is an extension of yourself. It's just that the data rate, the rate at which -- The communication rate between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself, that is your phone and computer, is slow. It's very slow."}
{"time": "00:29:22", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "And that is like a tiny straw of information flow between your biological self and your digital self. And we need to make that tiny straw like a giant river. A huge high band with the interface. It's an interface problem, data rate problem. It's all the data rate problem that I think we can hang on to human machine symbiosis through the long term. And then, people may decide that they want to retain their biological self or not. I think they'll probably choose to retain the biological self."}

You know, before you oversight, before you do make regulations, you should like try to understand what's going on. And then, you have an insight committee. Then, once they learn what's going on, you get up to speed. Then, they can make maybe some rules or proposed some rules. And that would be probably a safer way to go about things."}

The universe is 13.8 billion years old. Civilization, if you count it, if you're very generous, civilization is maybe 7000 or 8000 years old if you count it from the first writing. This is nothing.

{"time": "01:16:19", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I guess, thinking about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy. Once you've overcome gravitational potential energy, and you're out at a high altitude, the energy use in cruise is very low. And then, you can recapture a large part of the gravitational potential energy on the way down. So, you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy."}

So, the force balance -- So, a plane that is not accelerating is a neutral force balance. You have the force of gravity, you have the lift force, you have the wings. Then, you've got the force of the whatever thrusting device, so the propeller, or turbine, or whatever it is. And you've got the resistance force of the air."}

Air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square, and exponential beats the square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy. And at a certain altitude, you can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it's just a force balance."}

{"time": "01:18:48", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Solar energy is important. Stationary storage of energy is important. These things are much more important than creating electric supersonic futile. Also, the plane's naturally -- You really want that gravitational energy density for an aircraft, and this improving over time. So, you know, it's important that we accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. That's why electric cars, it matters whether electric cars happen sooner or later. You know, we're really playing a crazy game here with the atmosphere or the oceans."}
{"time": "01:19:23", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Yeah."}
{"time": "01:19:23", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "We're taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this in the atmosphere. It's just crazy. We should not do this. It's very dangerous. So, we should accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. I mean, the bizarre thing is that, obviously, we're going to run out of oil in the long term. You know, we're going to -- There's only so much oil we can mine and burn. It's totally logical. We must have a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term."}
{"time": "01:20:04", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "So, we know that's the endpoint. We know that. So, why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon from underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans? This is an insane experiment.

{"time": "01:21:50", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Right."}
{"time": "01:21:53", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "You know, we're really just -- When we -- Themore carbon we take out of the ground and add to the atmosphere, and a lot of it gets permeated into the oceans, the more dangerous it is. Like I don't think right -- Ithink we're okay right now. We can probably even add some more but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow."}
{"time": "01:22:16", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Like there's a vast base of industry, vast transportation system. Like there's Two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world. And the new car and truck production, if it was a 100% electric, that's only about 100 million per year. So, it would take -- If you could snap your fingers and instantly turn all cars and trucks electric, it would still take 25 years to change the transport base to electric. It makes sense because how long does a car and truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed? About 20 to 25 years."}
{"time": "01:23:00", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Is there a way to accelerate that process, like some sort of subsidies or some encouragement from the government financially?"}
{"time": "01:23:08", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Well, the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any oil-burning device. Any power plant or car is fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, or just the atmosphere for short. So, like, you can say, okay, there'sa certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere."}
{"time": "01:23:41", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "And so, there's some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon into the atmosphere, things overheat, oceans warm up, ice caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, you know, if something's underwater, but it's not clear what that number is. But, definitely, scientists, it's really quite -- The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Overwhelming."}
{"time": "01:24:13", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I mean, I don't know any serious scientist, actually zero, literally zero who don't think, you know, that we have quite a serious climate risk that we're facing. And so, that's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing, power plants, aircraft, car frankly even rockets. I mean, rockets use up -- you know, they burn. They burn fuel. But there's just -- you know, with rockets, there's just no other way to get to orbit unfortunately. So, it's the only way."}
{"time": "01:24:54", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "But with cars, there's definitely a better way with electric cars. And to generate the energy, do so with photovoltaics because we've got a giant nuclear reactor in the sky called the sun. It's great. It sort of shows up every day, very reliable. So, if you can generate energy from solar panels, store up with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours a day."}
{"time": "01:25:21", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "And then, you know, you can send to the polls or in the air tothe north with, you know, high voltage lines. Most of the northern parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well. But, anyway, all fossil fuel-powered things have an inherent subsidy, which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans."}
{"time": "01:25:48", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "So, people tend to think like why should electric vehicles have a subsidy, but they're not taking into account that all fossil fuel-burning vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost, the environmental cost to earth, but nobody's paying for it. We are going to pay for it, obviously. In the future, we'll pay for it. It's just not paid for now."}
{"time": "01:26:16", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "And what is the bottleneck in regards to electric cars, and trucks, and things like that? Is it battery capacity?"}

Do you feel like you like caught this, like you have got some -- you're like on some weird innovation creativity sort of wave that's very unusual?

You know, with Tesla, I want to try to make things that people love. Like, how do you think you could buy that you really love, that really give you joy? So rare, so rare.

{"time": "02:29:52", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "Well, I think one of those -- I think, part of that is just they've been -- you know, they've been struggling. When people struggle, they associate their struggle with other people. They never internalize their problems. They look to other people as holding them back, and people suck, and fuck people, and it's just -- You know, it's a never ending cycle. But not always. Again, most people are really good. Most people, the vast majority."}

{"time": "02:30:59", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "No, but probably spend more time with your friends and less time on social media."}

That weird feeling. This weird little negative jolt. It's like a subjective negative jolt of energy that you don't really need to absorb, but you do anyway. Like, \"I want to fuck this guy. Fuck him.\""}
{"time": "02:32:29", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "I mean, there's a lot of negativity on Twitter."}
{"time": "02:32:32", "speaker": "Joe Rogan", "text": "It is, but it's a weird in it's form. Like the way, if you ingest it as if you're like -- you try to be like a little scientist as you're ingesting it, you're like, \"How weird is this?\" And I'm even getting upset at some strange person saying something mean to me. It's not even accurate."}

You had that thought.\" I'm like, \"Well, I deleted it.\" \"Not good enough. You had the thought. I'm better than you. I never had that thought. You had that thought, you piece of shit.

{"time": "02:33:36", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah. I'm not sure why people think that anyone would think that deleting a tweet makes them go away. It's like, \"Hello, been on the internet for a while.\""}

It's like they're trying to catch you for something, more than they're logically looking at it thinking it's a bad thing that you've done, or that it's an idea they don't agree with so much, they needed to insult you. They're trying to catch you."}
{"time": "02:34:48", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person."}

{"time": "02:35:53", "speaker": "Elon Musk", "text": "No. I think, you know, I think people should be nicer to each other, and give more credit to others, and don't assume that they're mean until you know they're actually mean. You know, just, it's easy to demonize people. You're usually wrong about it. People are nicer than you think. Give people more credit."}
