Stem cells: What they are and what they do
Stem cells offer great promise for new medical treatments. Learn about stem cell types, current and possible uses, and the state of research and practice.

You've heard about stem cells in the news, and perhaps you've wondered if they might help you or a loved one with a serious disease. You may wonder what stem cells are, how they're being used to treat disease and injury, and why they're the subject of such vigorous debate.

Here are some answers to frequently asked questions about stem cells.

Stem cells are the body's raw materials — cells from which all other cells with specialized functions are generated. Under the right conditions in the body or a laboratory, stem cells divide to form more cells called daughter cells.

These daughter cells become either new stem cells or specialized cells (differentiation) with a more specific function, such as blood cells, brain cells, heart muscle cells or bone cells. No other cell in the body has the natural ability to generate new cell types.

Why is there such an interest in stem cells?
Researchers hope stem cell studies can help to:

Increase understanding of how diseases occur. By watching stem cells mature into cells in bones, heart muscle, nerves, and other organs and tissue, researchers may better understand how diseases and conditions develop.
Generate healthy cells to replace cells affected by disease (regenerative medicine). Stem cells can be guided into becoming specific cells that can be used in people to regenerate and repair tissues that have been damaged or affected by disease.

People who might benefit from stem cell therapies include those with spinal cord injuries, type 1 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, stroke, burns, cancer and osteoarthritis.

Stem cells may have the potential to be grown to become new tissue for use in transplant and regenerative medicine. Researchers continue to advance the knowledge on stem cells and their applications in transplant and regenerative medicine.

Test new drugs for safety and effectiveness. Before using investigational drugs in people, researchers can use some types of stem cells to test the drugs for safety and quality. This type of testing will most likely first have a direct impact on drug development for cardiac toxicity testing.

New areas of study include the effectiveness of using human stem cells that have been programmed into tissue-specific cells to test new drugs. For the testing of new drugs to be accurate, the cells must be programmed to acquire properties of the type of cells targeted by the drug. Techniques to program cells into specific cells are under study.

For instance, nerve cells could be generated to test a new drug for a nerve disease. Tests could show whether the new drug had any effect on the cells and whether the cells were harmed.

Where do stem cells come from?
There are several sources of stem cells:

These are pluripotent (ploo-RIP-uh-tunt) stem cells, meaning they can divide into more stem cells or can become any type of cell in the body. This versatility allows embryonic stem cells to be used to regenerate or repair diseased tissue and organs.

Adult stem cells. These stem cells are found in small numbers in most adult tissues, such as bone marrow or fat. Compared with embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells have a more limited ability to give rise to various cells of the body.

Until recently, researchers thought adult stem cells could create only similar types of cells. For instance, researchers thought that stem cells residing in the bone marrow could give rise only to blood cells.

However, emerging evidence suggests that adult stem cells may be able to create various types of cells. For instance, bone marrow stem cells may be able to create bone or heart muscle cells.

This research has led to early-stage clinical trials to test usefulness and safety in people. For example, adult stem cells are currently being tested in people with neurological or heart disease.

Adult cells altered to have properties of embryonic stem cells. Scientists have successfully transformed regular adult cells into stem cells using genetic reprogramming. By altering the genes in the adult cells, researchers can reprogram the cells to act similarly to embryonic stem cells.

This new technique may allow use of reprogrammed cells instead of embryonic stem cells and prevent immune system rejection of the new stem cells. However, scientists don't yet know whether using altered adult cells will cause adverse effects in humans.

Researchers have been able to take regular connective tissue cells and reprogram them to become functional heart cells. In studies, animals with heart failure that were injected with new heart cells experienced improved heart function and survival time.

What is stem cell therapy (regenerative medicine) and how does it work?
Stem cell therapy, also known as regenerative medicine, promotes the repair response of diseased, dysfunctional or injured tissue using stem cells or their derivatives. It is the next chapter in organ transplantation and uses cells instead of donor organs, which are limited in supply.

Researchers grow stem cells in a lab. These stem cells are manipulated to specialize into specific types of cells, such as heart muscle cells, blood cells or nerve cells.

The specialized cells can then be implanted into a person. For example, if the person has heart disease, the cells could be injected into the heart muscle. The healthy transplanted heart muscle cells could then contribute to repairing the injured heart muscle.

Researchers have already shown that adult bone marrow cells guided to become heart-like cells can repair heart tissue in people, and more research is ongoing.

Have stem cells already been used to treat diseases?
Yes. Doctors have performed stem cell transplants, also known as bone marrow transplants. In stem cell transplants, stem cells replace cells damaged by chemotherapy or disease or serve as a way for the donor's immune system to fight some types of cancer and blood-related diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma and multiple myeloma. These transplants use adult stem cells or umbilical cord blood.

Researchers are testing adult stem cells to treat other conditions, including a number of degenerative diseases such as heart failure.

Researchers have discovered ways to direct stem cells to become specific types of cells, such as directing embryonic stem cells to become heart cells. Research is ongoing in this area.



This article explains the costs associated with different stem cell treatments, what will impact the price, and why stem cell therapy may be a good alternative to traditional medications.

Stem cell therapy costs can range anywhere from $5000-$50,000 USD. Treatment cost will vary dramatically depending on a variety of different factors.

Stem cell therapy cost can be influenced by:

The type of stem cells administered
How many cells are administered
The quality of the cells (are the ethically sourced, viable & regulated?)
Where the laboratory is located (for cell expansion)
The source of stem cells (umbilical cord tissue, adipose tissue, bone marrow, etc.)
It is also important to note that the cost of stem cell therapy will vary depending on the type of treatment needed. The cost of a site injection for an orthopedic condition will be significantly different than an intravenous treatment for an autoimmune condition.

Average Cost of Stem Cell Therapy
The average stem cell therapy cost can range anywhere between $5000 - $50,000. Patients must do their research and ask as many questions as they can before financially committing to treatment. Make sure to know how many cells you are getting, where those cells come from, if they are viable, is the clinic/lab is regulated, and ask for as detailed info to be provided as possible. When considering a potentially life-changing treatment, prospective patients should be weighing these other important factors, in addition to cost, when determining the best location for experimental procedures.

Stem cell umbilical cord cost
The cost of private cord blood banking ranges from $300 to $2,300 for collection, processing and initial storage, with additional annual storage fees after that. Stem cell therapy can costs can range anywhere from $5000-$50,000 USD, with the average cost of treatment at DVC Stem costs $25,000 USD.

How does the stem cell clinic influence the cost of treatment?
There are several factors that can influence the cost of treatment at a stem cell clinic, including:

How much does stem cell therapy cost?
Stem cell therapies have become very popular in recent years, as people are seeking the latest alternative treatments for their many conditions. More and more types of therapies are being introduced every day, and people around the world are turning to them and rejecting traditional regimens of drugs and hospital visits. However, despite the large surge in demand for stem cell therapies, they still remain very expensive to pursue. Even simple joint injections can cost nearly $5000 and more advanced treatments can rise in cost up to $100,000 depending on the condition.

Stem cell therapy cost for knees or a degenerative condition such as Crohn's Disease may differ from stem cell therapy cost for COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). The area and issue being treated should generally influence the cost of the associated treatment because different cell types, cell counts and treatment protocols will be needed. For example, an effective stem cell therapy cost for MS will be much different than the cost of a site injection for localized pain.

Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) injections
Birth tissues (umbilical cord blood or amniotic fluid)
Adipose (fat) tissue or bone marrow
Allogenic culture-expanded stem cell procedure (umbilical cord tissue)

These treatments can range from $4000 - $8,000 in the United States. Adipose (fat) and Bone Marrow stem cell treatments can be effective for certain orthopedic conditions, but studies have shown that they are not a viable treatment option for chronic widespread inflammation or autoimmune conditions due to a variety of factors including lower cell count and potency. This is what makes expanded cord tissue-derived stem cells so revolutionary.

The cost can influence stem cell therapy success rate
Increased costs and regulation can potentially increase the success rate of stem cell therapy in a few different ways.

Patient reported results have since shown that ~85% of our total patient population have noted a sustained improvement in their condition within 3 months of treatment. This data is measured via a follow-up vitality questionnaire that is compared to baseline results collected within 3 months prior to treatment in conjunction with unique inflammatory marker testing.
More specifically, the current average improvements for our  patients 3 months after treatment are as follows:

75% increase in Stamina
53.75% increase in Libido
51.40% increase in Energy Levels
43.97% increase in Balance
28% increase in Coordination
23.19% increase in Strength
21% increase in Vision
Average improvements concerning cognitive function 12 months after treatment are as follows:

19.84% improvement in Memory
44% improvement in Ability to Concentrate
31.94% improvement in Decision Making
12.5% increase in Quality of Sleep

So why is stem cell therapy so expensive?
The short answer to that question is that the stem cell field is still highly specialized and has not been adopted by the mainstream and insurance companies. Additionally, the field is further restricted by older laws in the United States. That means that there are very few sources for stem cells, labs that are equipped to process stem cells, and reputable clinics that provide the treatments, most of which are located outside the US. Just as with an expensive food or item of clothing, the problem is with availability and production cost.

To fully understand the cost, you first have to look at the treatment preparation process. Stem cells are first acquired by companies that pay hospitals for donated cord tissue, or by doctors that perform fat tissue or bone marrow extractions. The cells are then sent to separate companies which run laboratories that specialize in stem cell expansion. These labs usually have very qualified and specialized staff members and are under the strict regulations of the FDA. The cells are then shipped in cryo-storage overnight around the world to the stem cell clinic. These clinics are staffed with doctors, nurses, and support staff that all play a part in the patient’s experience. This includes everything from marketing, to logistics and the actual medical care. In every stage of this process, there are heavy costs associated with time and labor, before the patient is ever given treatment.

Does stem cell therapy cost vary in different countries?
Yes it does, and that is highly dependent on the lab where the cells are acquired from, the total count of stem cells administered and the regulations the governing body places on the clinic. For example, stem cell therapy cost in Mexico will differ from stem cell therapy costs in Panama and Grand Cayman. For example, DVC Stem in Grand Cayman uses culturally expanded cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells sourced from their cGMP, FDA compliant partner lab in the USA.

Stem cell treatment in Mexico
Mexico has become a popular destination for stem cell therapy, with many clinics offering treatment for a variety of conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS). MS stem cell treatment in Mexico has gained attention as a potential alternative to traditional therapies, as it may help to reduce inflammation and improve function in patients with this chronic neurological condition.

Stem cell therapy in Mexico is also being explored as a treatment option for other conditions such as arthritis, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord injuries. It is important to note that while stem cell therapy in Mexico may offer promising results, it is important to do your research and carefully evaluate the credentials and reputation of any stem cell clinic before undergoing treatment. It is also essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional to determine if stem cell therapy is an appropriate treatment option for your specific condition.

Who is performing the procedure?
Stem cell therapy cost is linked to whoever performs the treatment. There are a few different types of medical providers that may have the ability to inject the cells.

How long do stem cell injections last?
This can be influenced by a variety of factors. To make things simple at DVC Stem, our stem cell clinic in Grand Cayman, we inject over 300 million mesenchymal stem cells intravenously (IV). Currently DVC Stem's treatment protocol does not call for a specific re-treatment period. If patients are happy with the results, no other treatment is necessary. We do have patients return to us on an annual basis voluntarily to maintain sustained benefit.
