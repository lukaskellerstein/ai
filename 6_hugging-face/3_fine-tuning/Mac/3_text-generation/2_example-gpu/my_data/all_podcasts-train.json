And then, you canrecapture a large part of the gravitational potential energy on the way down. So, you really don't need any kind ofreserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of height, gravitational potential energy. This is a lot of energy. So, once you can get high, like the way to think about a plane is it's a force balance. So, the force balance -- So, aplane that is not accelerating is a neutral force balance. You have the force of gravity, you have the lift force, you havethe wings. Then, you've got the force of the whatever thrusting device, so the propeller, or turbine, or whatever it is. Andyou've got the resistance force of the air. Now, the higher you go, the lower the air resistance is. Air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with thesquare, and exponential beats the square. The higher you go, the faster you will go for the same amount of energy.And at a certain altitude, you can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile than anaircraft at 35,000 feet because it's just a force balance."

  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Well, the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any oil-burning device. Any power plantor car is fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, or just the atmosphere for short.So, like, you can say, okay, there'sa certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbonconcentration in the atmosphere. And so, there's some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon into the atmosphere, things overheat, oceanswarm up, ice caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, you know, if something's underwater, but it'snot clear what that number is. But, definitely, scientists, it's really quite -- The scientific consensus is overwhelming.Overwhelming. I mean, I don't know any serious scientist, actually zero, literally zero who don't think, you know, that we have quite aserious climate risk that we're facing. And so, that's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burningthing, power plants, aircraft, car frankly even rockets. I mean, rockets use up -- you know, they burn. They burn fuel.But there's just -- you know, with rockets, there's just no other way to get to orbit unfortunately. So, it's the only way. But with cars, there's definitely a better way with electric cars. And to generate the energy, do so with photovoltaicsbecause we've got a giant nuclear reactor in the sky called the sun. It's great. It sort of shows up every day, veryreliable. So, if you can generate energy from solar panels, store up with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours aday. And then, you know, you can send to the polls or in the air tothe north with, you know, high voltage lines. Most of thenorthern parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well. But, anyway, all fossil fuel-powered things have aninherent subsidy, which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans. So, people tend to think like why should electric vehicles have a subsidy, but they're not taking into account that allfossil fuel-burning vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost, the environmental cost to earth, but nobody'spaying for it. We are going to pay for it, obviously. In the future, we'll pay for it. It's just not paid for now."

And it's trying to basically layout timelessprinciples of wealth creation that if you absorb them, you become the kind of person who can create wealth, createbusiness, make money. And my theory behind that is like there are three things everybody wants. There's actually morethan three, but let's start with three. The three basics. Everybody wants to be wealthy, everybody wants to be happyand everybody wants to be fit. And I know there's a lot of virtue sitting that goes on, like we don't want money and, youknow, I don't care about being happy, and happiness is for stupid people.

There a lot of people who you've had on here including yourself who know a heck of a lot more about fitnessand health than I do. But I was born poor and miserable and I'm now pretty well off and I'm very happy. And I worked atthose, and so I've learned a few things. There are some principles. And so I try to lay them out, but in a timelessmanner where you can kind of figure it out yourself. Because at the end of the day, I can't really teach anything, I canonly inspire you and maybe give you a few hooks, so you can remember things when they happen, or put a name tothem. So this podcast actually ended up explaining this tweet storm. So there's a tweet storm with like 36, 38 tweets,got very famous, got translated in dozens of languages. And these were principles that I came up with for myself when Iwas really young, around 13, 14. And I've been carrying them in my head for 30 years and I'd been sort of living them.And over time I just realized, like, sadly, or fortunately, the thing that I got really good at was looking at businesses andfiguring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that. And do it in very longterm kind of way, not the, you know, banker crash the economy."

I just -- I feel like, if you have something original and interesting to say, you should say it.Otherwise it's probably been said better. So that podcast tries to be information dense. It tries to be very concise, it triesto be high impact, it tries to be timeless, and it has all the information. I think you need the principle that if you absorbedthese, and you work hard over 10 years, you'll get what you want. So I've got the one on wealth creation, I'm going toattempt to do one on -- happiness is a big word but -- you know, happiness and inner peace and calm and all that.Because what you want is you don't want to be the guy who succeeds in life while being high strung, high stress, andunhappy and leaving a trail of emotional wreckage with you and your loved ones."

But if you're serious, you announce it on Facebook. You'll tell yourfriends, you'll tell your wife, you'll say, \"I'm done drinking. I'm throwing everything out of the house. You'll never see medrink again.\" When you say that you know you're serious. So I think a lot of these are choices that we make. Andhappiness is just one of those choices. And this is unpopular to say because there are people who are actuallydepressed, you know, chemically or what have you.

But desire, to me, is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get whatyou want. Okay? And I keep that in front of minds. So when I'm unhappy about something, I look for what is theunderlying desire that I have that's not being fulfilled. It's okay to have desires. You're a biological creature, and you puton this earth, you have to do something, you have to have desires, you have a mission. But don't have too many. Don'tpick them up unconsciously. Don't pick them up randomly. Don't have thousands of them. My coffee's too cold, doesn'ttaste quite right. I'm not sitting perfectly. Oh, I wish it was warmer. You know. My dog, you know, pooped in the lawn, Idon't like that. Whatever it is. Pick your one overwhelming desire. It's okay to suffer over that one, but on all the others,do you want to let them go so you can be calm and peaceful and relaxed? And then you'll perform a better job. Mostpeople, when you're unhappy, like a depressed person, it's not that they have very clear calm mind. They're too busy intheir mind. Their sense of self is too strong. They're sitting indoors all the time. Their minds working, working, working.They're thinking too much. Well, if you want to be a high performance athlete, how good of an athlete are you gonna beif you're always having epileptic seizures? If you're always like twitching and running around and like jumping, and yourlimbs or flailing out of control? The same way if you want to be effective in business, you need a clear, calm, cool,collected mind. Warren Buffett plays bridge all day long and goes for walks in the sun. He doesn't sit around likeconstantly loading his brain with non-stop information and getting worked up about every little thing. We live in an ageof infinite leverage. What I mean by that is that your actions can be multiplied a thousand fold, either by broadcasting ata podcast or by investing capital or by having people work for you or by writing code. So because of that, the impacts ofgood decision making are much higher than they used to be. Because now you can influence thousands or millions ofpeople through your decisions or your code. So, a clear mind leads to better judgment, leads to a better outcome. So ahappy, calm, peaceful person, will make better decisions and have better outcomes. So if you want to operate at peakperformance, you have to learn how to tame your mind just like you've learned how to tame your body."

But the information age is breaking that down. So Ronald Coase is aneconomist who has this coast here and a very famous theorem, but he basically just talks about why is a company thesize that it is. Why is a company one person, instead of ten people, instead of one hundred, instead of a thousand. Andit has to do with the internal transaction costs which is the external transaction costs. Let's say I want to do something --let's say I'm building a house, and I need someone to come in and provide the lumber. I'm a developer, right? Do I wantthat to be part of my company? Or do I want that to be an external provider? A lot of it just depends on how hard it is todo that transaction with someone externally versus internally. If it's too hard to keep doing the contract every timeexternally, I'll bring that in-house. If it's easy to do externally and it's a one-off kind of thing, I'd rather keep it out of thehouse. Well, information technology is making it easier and easier to do these transactions externally. It's becomingmuch easier to communicate with people. Gig economy, I can send you small amounts of money, I can hire you throughan app, I can rate you afterwards. So we're seeing an atomization of the firm. We're seeing the optimal size of the firmsshrinking. It's most obvious in Silicon Valley. Tons and tons of startups constantly coming up and shaving off littlepieces of businesses from large companies and turning them into huge markets.

It's kind of how Hollywood already works a little bit with how theyorganize for a project, you decide whether to take the project or not. The contract is right there on the spot. You get paida certain amount. You get rated every day or every week. You get the money delivered. And then when you're doneworking, you turn it off and you go to Tahiti or wherever you want to spend the next three months. And I think the smartpeople have already started figuring out that the internet enables this. And they're starting to work more and moreremotely on their own schedule, on their own time, on their own place, with their own friends, in their own way. Andthat's actually how we are the most productive. So the information revolution by making easier to communicate,connect and cooperate, is allowing us to go back to working for ourselves. And that is my ultimate dream. Even when Irun a company and I have employees, I always tell those people, \"Hey, I'm gonna help you start your company whenyou're ready.\" Because I think that's the highest calling. Maybe not everybody will get there, but it would be fine if wewere -- even working at 10 person company or 20 person company is way better than working in 1,000 personcompany or 10,000 person company. So this idea that we're all factory, like cogs in a machine, who are specialized andhave to do things by rote memorization or instruction is gonna go away and we're gonna go back to being small groupsof creative bands of individuals, setting out to do missions. And when those missions are done, we collect our money,we get rated, and then we rest and reassess until we're ready for the next sprint."

But the moment you start having a direct transfer mechanism like that in a democracy, you're basically doing itwith capitalism which is the engine of economic growth. You're also forcing the entrepreneurs out or telling them not tocome here. The estimate I saw for 15 K, your basic income for everybody would be three quarters of current GDP. Andof course GDP would shrink in response as all the entrepreneurs fled. So you would essentially bankrupt the country.Another issue with UBI is that, people who are down on their luck, they're not looking for handouts. It's not just aboutmoney. It's also about status. It's about meaning. And the moment I start giving money to you and put you on the dole,I've lowered your status, I've made you a second class citizen. So I have to give you meaning. And meaning comesthrough education and capability. You have to teach a man to fish, not to basically throw your rotting leftover carcassesat him and say, \"Here, eat the scraps.\" So it doesn't solve the meaning problem. And lastly it's nonsense to hand 15 Kout to everybody, you want to means test people. There's no reason to give it to you and me. So you end up backtowards the welfare system where you do have to figure out who needs it and who doesn't. So I think the better route isthat we actually establish a set of basic substance services that you have to have and we provide those in abundanceto technology based automation. So get basic housing, get basic food, get basic transportation, get high speed internetaccess, get a phone in your pocket. Those are the kinds of things you want to give people. And finally, in terms of therate of automation, I think we can educate people very quickly. One of the myths that we have today is that adults can'tbe reeducated. We view education as this thing where you go to school, you come out and you're out of college andyou're done. No more education. Well, that's wrong. You have all these great online boot camps and coding schoolscoming up there are ones that even pay you to go there now. You can educate people and mass, and you can educatethem into creative professions. People who are talking about AI automating programming -- I've neverreally writtenserious code. Coding is thinking, it's automatic structure of thinking. And AI, they can program as well or better thanhumans is an AI that just took over the world. That's end game. That's the end of the human species. And I can giveyou arguments why I don't think that's coming either. People who are thinking -- and I know it take the opposite sidefrom some very famous people in this debate, but we're nowhere near close to General A.I. Not in our lifetimes.

There is nothing approaching what we call creative thinking.To actually model general intelligence, you run into all kinds of problems. First, we don't know how the brain works atall. Number two, we've never even modeled a paramecium or an amoeba, let alone a human brain. Number three,there's this assumption that all of the computation is going at the cellular level, at the neuron level, whereas nature isvery parsimonious. It uses everything at its disposal. There's a lot of machinery inside the cell that is doing calculationsthat is intelligent that isn't accounted for. And the best estimates are would take 50 years of Moore's Law before we cansimulate what's going on inside a cell near perfectly, and probably 100 years before we can build a brain that cansimulate inside the cells. So putting it at saying that I'm just gonna model neuron is on or off, and then use that to buildthe human brain is overly simplistic. Furthermore, I would posit there's no such thing as general intelligence. Everyintelligence is contextual within the context of the environment that it senses. It evolves in theenvironment around it.So I think a lot of people who are pedaling general AI the burden of proof is on them. I haven't seen anything that wouldlead me to indicate we're approaching general AI. Instead, we're solving deterministic closed set finite problems usinglarge amounts of data, but it's not sexy to talk about that."

So capitalism has gotten a really bad name. Let's talk aboutits free exchange, free markets. Free markets and free exchange are intrinsic to humans, from when the first personstarted a fire and somebody came along with a deer and said, \"Hey, if I cook my dear on your fire, I'll share some of itwith you,\" right? So specialization of labor, we trade, that's built into the human species. Basic math comes fromaccounting, keeping track of debts and credits and so on. We need to be able to engage in free trade. The correctcriticism of capitalism is when it does not provide equal opportunity. And so we should always strive to provide equalopportunity. But people confuse that with equal outcome. When you have equal outcome, that can only be enforcedthrough violence. Because different people -- free people make different choices. And when they make differentchoices, they have different outcomes. If you don't let them suffer the consequences of bad choices or reap therewards from good choices, then you are forcibly redistributing through violence. It's interesting that there isn't -- thatthere are no socialist -- working socialist examples that exist without violence.

You hand this over to that person.\" So one of the reasons whyI do this podcast is because I believe everybody can be wealthy. Everybody. It's not a zero sum game. It is a positivesum game.

You live in your house alone. Your parents don't live nearby. Yourfriends don't live nearby. You don't have any tribal meaning. You don't believe in religion anymore. You don't believe incountry anymore. It's fine. You got a lot of freedoms. Fantastic. But, now, when they come to attack you, you're aloneand you can't resist. So how do they attack you? It's all well-meaning. I don't fought capitalism, I love capitalism. But,look at how it happened. Social media, they've massaged all the mechanisms to addict you like a skinner pigeon or arat who's just gonna click, click, click, click, click. Can't put the phone down. The food, they've taken sugar and they'veweaponized it. They've put it into all these different forms and varieties that you can't resist eating.

If you're a young male, you wonder on the internet, it'lllike sapped away your libido and you're not going out in real life society anymore because you've got this incrediblystimulating stuff coming at you. Video games, another way to addict people. So, you have this -- you have entire largefactories of people that are working to addict you to these things and you stand alone.

So the internet is this giantaggregator where it creates one big [inaudible 0:59:16] for everything, and it creates an atomized long tail of millionsand millions of individuals. What it gets rid of is the medium sized ones in the middle. So, for example, you might havehad like seven Hollywood studios, let's all give me Netflix. You had, you know, like 10 large e-commerce players --commerce players, from Walmart to Costco to, you know, Kmart and whatever. Not just gonna be Amazon. And a tonof small individual brands. So that's the world that we're headed towards; one [inaudible 0:59:48] and millions ofindividuals. So where it ends up long term is media will be a few gigantic outlets. You know, it could be the New YorkTimes, it could be Facebook, a few like that, and there's gonna be just a really long tail of millions of independentpeople. So this idea of who's a journalist and who's not, you know, is assigned to journalists or not. Everyone's ajournalist. That's the world that we're headed towards. I do think that extreme power, the most powerful people in theworld today, and this is not well-known, but the most powerful people in the world today are the people who are writingthe algorithms for Twitter and Facebook and Instagram. Because they're controlling the spread of information. They'reliterally rewriting people's brains. They're programming the culture. And they're doing it very subtly. Like Google, Ibelieve, that, you know, one of their Execs got up in front of Congress, and the Congressman asked him, you know,\"Do you manipulate search results?\" He said, \"No, we do not manipulate search results.\" \"Really? That's your job. Thatis literally all Google does. Google has one job which is to manipulate search results to pull them out of the noise andrank them properly.\" And the precise algorithms of how they do that is very hidden, very complex, but influences thehearts and minds of everybody, including all the voters. Now, if Google, Facebook and Twitter had been smart aboutthis, they would not have picked sides. They would have said, \"We're publishers. Whatever goes through our pipesgoes through the pipes. If it's illegal, we'll take it down, give us a court order. Otherwise we don't touch it.\" It's like thephone company. If I call you up."

Slope intoruin where the left wants them to take down the right, the right wants to take down the left, and now they have no morefriends, they have no allies. Traditionally the libertarian leaning Republicans and Democrats would have stood up inprinciple for the common carriers, but now they won't. So, my guess is as soon as Congress --this is -- this day iscoming, if not already here. It might even have been here today actually, because you saw something related in thenews. The day is coming when the politicians realize that these social media platforms are picking the next president,the next Congressman. They are literally picking.

Leviathan is the government, why does it slouch left?And I think a lot of that has been because of technology. Technology has made it so that it makes more -- it's likeindustrial revolution technology. We all band together. We're wards of the state, right? Contraception is a technologythat kind of helps lean left where it takes away from the family unit. Abortion is a technology, right? It wasn't possiblethousands of years ago. So technology actually empowers the individual. The individual means that you have thebreakdown of family structure and religion and all that. And I'm not necessarily opposed to that. But it does mean thatthere is a leftward shift to it. Now we are getting a small set of technologies that actually can take you more rightward.Encryption is an example, because encryption makes it easier to have privacy.

Well, let's look at the University, what do they have to say? What are the smartest people, theprofessors, the think tanks have to say?\" And the universities got this credibility from the hard sciences. So they got thisfrom, you know, physics and math and computer science and chemistry, because these deliver real things; theManhattan Project, the microprocessor, the space vehicles and so on, the electric car. So they gain this mantle ofauthority and legitimacy from the hard sciences. So then, come the social sciences kind of sneak in. Then you geteconomy -- economics. And microeconomics is a real discipline, real science, real math behind it, logic, reason. Andthen you get macro economics which can be politicized a little bit more voodoo, and then you get social studies, andthen you get gender studies, and then you get blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. And so what happened is thatbecause we took scientists to be the high priests of our new world, science itself has gotten corrupted. And the socialsciences, and you can tell they're fake sciences because the word science tacked on at the end have come in andhijacked the universities and become the new think tanks. And so, essentially, what you see going on today in theuniversities is a war between the social sciences and the physical sciences. And the crossover point is biology, right?Where you can see like the whole gender is a social construct movement is attacking biology and evolutionary biology.Just like in the social sphere, they're coming after the comedians, right?

All this stuff happening to you in your life. And some of it you'reprocessing, some of it you're absorbing, and some of it you should probably think a little bit more about and workthrough, but you don't, you don't have time. So it gets buried in you. It's all these preferences and judgments andunresolved situations and issues. And it's like your e-mail inbox. It's just piling up, e-mail after e-mail after e-mail that'snot answered, going back 10, 20, 30, 40 years. And then when you sit down to meditate, those e-mails start comingback at you. \"Hey, what about this issue? What about that issue? Have you solved this? Do you think about that? Youhave regrets there? You have issues there?\" And that gets scary. People don't want to do that. Like, \"It's not working. Ican't clear my mind. I better get up and not do this.\" But really what's happening is it's self therapy. It's just that, insteadof paying a therapist to sit there and listen to you, you're listening to yourself. And you just have to sit there as those emails go through one by one, you work through each of them until you get to the magical inbox zero. And there comes aday when you sit down, you realize the only things you're thinking about are the things that happened yesterday,because you've processed everything else. Not necessarily even resolved it, but at least listen to yourself, and that'swhen meditation starts. And I think it's a very powerful thing that everybody should experience and that's when youarrive upon the art of doing nothing."

Because when you're actuallytrying to live your life in congruence with reality, you want to have a deep understanding what you do and why you do it.And so it's much more important to know the basics really well there is to know the advanced. Knowing calculuswouldn't help you today, doesn't help you in business, doesn't help you in most things. But knowing arithmetic reallywell will help you, really, whether it's at the corner grocery store counting change, to figuring out the value of yourpodcast business, to figuring out how to do the probability math on, you know, some action that you want to take. Sounderstanding basic mathematics cold is way more important than memorizing calculus concepts. And the problem is --and this is true of, I think, all reasoning, it's much better to know the basics from the ground up solid foundation ofunderstanding, a steel frame of understanding, than it is to just have a scaffolding, we're just memorizing advancedconcepts. This is why that a lot of people I'm sure that you listen to who are really smart, they use a lot of jargon andyou can't quite follow their reasoning. You don't know how they're putting things together and you -- this deep downsuspicion, \"They don't even really understand.\" Right? So if you look at the most powerful thinkers especially the oneswhere money or life is on the line, they have to understand the basics really, really well. Richard Feynman, the famousphysicist was able to -- he had this piece in one of his lectures where he takes you from counting numbers on yourhand, all the way to calculus in four pages of text aurally but written down to four pages of text. And it's a completeunbroken logical chain that takes you through geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, analytic geometry, graphs,everything, all the way to calculus. He understood numbers at a core level. He didn't have to memorize anything. Whenyou're memorizing, it's an indication that you don't understand. You should be able to re-derive anything on the spot.And if you can't, you don't know it."

Learn to smile more. Learn to hug more these things actually released serotonin in reverse. They aren'tjust outward signals of being happy. They're actually feedback loops to being happy.

You know, it's ludicrous. But pick an aspirationalhourly rate. Aspirational. It has to be a little ludicrous.

Thecost of meetings is so high, especially given all the people who are in there, right? One person is talking, seven peoplelistening, you're literally just dying an hour at a time. So you have to just drop non-urgent meetings or figure out how tobe more efficient with them if you gonna do anything great. The extreme example is business travel.
