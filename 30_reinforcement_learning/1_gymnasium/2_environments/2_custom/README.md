**Gymnasium environment** (previously OpenAI Gym) has a defined structure and requires the implementation of certain functions to be considered valid. Gymnasium follows a specific **API** that all custom environments must adhere to in order to be compatible with reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks.

### **Minimal Required Functions for a Gymnasium Environment**

To be a valid Gymnasium environment, an environment **must** implement:

1. **`__init__(self, ...)`**

   - Initialize the environment.
   - Define action space (`self.action_space`) and observation space (`self.observation_space`).
   - Set up any environment parameters.

2. **`reset(self, seed=None, options=None) -> (obs, info)`**

   - Resets the environment to its initial state.
   - Returns:
     - `obs`: The initial observation.
     - `info`: (optional) Dictionary with additional debug information.

3. **`step(self, action) -> (obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`**

   - Executes an action in the environment.
   - Returns:
     - `obs`: The new observation.
     - `reward`: The reward received for the action.
     - `terminated`: `True` if the episode has ended due to success/failure.
     - `truncated`: `True` if the episode was forcibly ended (e.g., time limit).
     - `info`: (optional) Dictionary with extra debug information.

4. **`render(self, mode="human")`** (optional but recommended)

   - Displays a visualization of the environment.

5. **`close(self)`** (optional)
   - Releases resources when the environment is no longer needed.

### **What Happens If Some Methods or Parameters Are Missing?**

- **If `reset` or `step` is missing**, the environment is **not valid** and will not work with Gymnasium-based RL libraries.
- **If `step` does not return all required values** (`obs`, `reward`, `terminated`, `truncated`, `info`), it will cause errors.
- **If `truncated` is missing** (older Gym versions only used `done`), it may still work but is **not fully compatible** with the latest Gymnasium API.
- **If `render` or `close` is missing**, the environment can still function but will not support visualization.

### **Valid but Partially Functional Environments**

A Gymnasium environment can still be "technically valid" **if it implements only `reset` and `step` correctly** but omits optional features. However:

- If it lacks `render`, it cannot visualize the environment.
- If it lacks `info` dictionaries, debugging information may be missing.
- If it does not follow Gymnasium's exact return structure, RL libraries may not work properly with it.
